"Technical Interview - Python, SQL, Problem but NOT Leetcode?",1cmnf0m,"I'm have technical interviews with a fintech company, and they (HR) have specifically told me that the interview will be on Problem Solving, SQL, and Python.

The position is for a Data Scientist, 2+ YOE.

I'm prepping by brushing up all my SQL, running through Ace the Data Science Interview for ML theory (and conceptual questions), and largely ignoring pure statistics/probabilities for now.

In a way, I'm thankful that it's not Leetcode because I suck ass at DS&A, but also I don't really know what to expect?

For the Python piece, I was thinking going over training models with sklearn (full pipeline, train-test-split, normalizatoin, scaling etc.), building some models from scratch (zzzz, linear regression, logistic regression), building some algorithms from scratch (cosine distance, bag of words, count vectorizer), pandas dataframe manipulation, numpy linear algebra.

Just wondering are there any ideas for what else I could expect? Is this list a good idea to prep?

Not sure if ""it WONT be Leetcode"" means, it will be DS&A just not problems from Leetcode, or it means nothing like DS&A at all.

HR interviewer said verbatim: ""if you know how to dev, you will get it"" which was new.

Thanks!

Learn how to add value with AI to dinosuar companies,1cnb8o7,"Just had a big meeting for the data team at my company (big pharma). They kept saying ""AI first company"" and ""save money through AI"" and ""improve productivity with AI"" etc. However, when I stood up to ask what they were planning on to implement this they had very little top-down ideas, probably due to a lack of understanding of the tech or no direct incentives to do so. Instead it seemed like the employees would generate ideas and figure out how to engineer it. 

  
Where I'm going with this is that if you're trying to break into the field or stand out this is a great opportunity. the leadership typically doesn't know what use cases exist for AI or how to measure it. If you can sell yourself like this on a resume/interview it seems like a good way to stand out. So taking a AI application and use case from begining to end seems like a new potential backdoor to get some attention. Also showing that you're the guy that can provide a method to show that the use case is effective (since they don't yet know how to measure impact). Being able to do this demonstrates business knowledge, tech skills, engineering, etc. and is a buzzword people love. Im still not sure if recruiters are instructed to look for these things, but in a networking setting its definitely $$$$. ""I built this AI stack to save the commetical analyst xx% in producing their weekly reports by ......... ultimately saving the company $\_\_\_\_.

Am I leveling down if I apply a associate data scientist positions?,1cn7iyn,"I have masters in biostatistics and I worked  2.5 years as research statistician.

Recommendation for Coursera or Udemy courses?,1cmrvht,"Data Science undergrad here, just finished off my first year, and I'm looking to just improve technical skills.

However, I'm primarily looking for courses, I can take to just put me ahead of the curve. Especially for when I apply to internships later this year (for next year) and to help me build some nice projects to beef up and build a portfolio.

Any recommendations? Started an IBM Data Science course on Coursera, but it's been very underwhelming thus far, thought to maybe start looking at some python, and SQL courses on Udemy.

This position is, unfortunately, in the tobacco industry. My concern is that by working here, it may turn off future employers whenever I need to transition.

The company has stated that their focus is on hazard mitigation of the products, so I'd imagine my work would pertain to that. However, I still don't know if that would mitigate the negative perception   of the role.

Put my foot down and refused to go ahead with what would amount to almost 8 hours of interviews for a senior data scientist position.,1cjdhdz,"I initially was  going to have a quick call (20 minutes) with a recruiter that ended up taking almost 45 minutes where I feel I was grilled enough on my background, it wasn't just do you know, x,y and z? They delved much deeper, which is fine, I suppose it helps figuring out right away if the candidate has at least the specific knowledge before they try to test it. But after that the recruiter stated that the interview process was over several days, as they like to go quick:

 - 1.5 hours long interview with the HM
 - 1.5 hours long interview focusing on coding + general data science.
 - 1.5 hours long interview focusing on machine learning.
 - 1.5 hour long interview with the entire team, general aspect questions.
 - 1 hour long interview with the VP of data science.


So between the 7 hours and the initial 45 minutes, I am expected to miss the equivalent of an entire day of work, so they can ask me unclear questions or on issues unrelated to work.


I told the recruiter, I need to bow out and this is too much. It would feel like I insulted the entire lineage of the company after I said that. They started talking about how that's their process, and it is the same for all companies to require this sort of vetting. Which to be clear, there is no managing people, I am still an individual recruiter. I just told them that's unreasonable, and good luck finding a candidate.

AI startup debuts “hallucination-free” and causal AI for enterprise data analysis and decision support,1clkibc,"https://venturebeat.com/ai/exclusive-alembic-debuts-hallucination-free-ai-for-enterprise-data-analysis-and-decision-support/

Artificial intelligence startup Alembic announced today it has developed a new AI system that it claims completely eliminates the generation of false information that plagues other AI technologies, a problem known as “hallucinations.” In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Alembic co-founder and CEO Tomás Puig revealed that the company is introducing the new AI today in a keynote presentation at the Forrester B2B Summit and will present again next week at the Gartner CMO Symposium in London.

The key breakthrough, according to Puig, is the startup’s ability to use AI to identify causal relationships, not just correlations, across massive enterprise datasets over time. “We basically immunized our GenAI from ever hallucinating,” Puig told VentureBeat. “It is deterministic output. It can actually talk about cause and effect.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1clkibc/ai_startup_debuts_hallucinationfree_and_causal_ai/,Heavy-Painting-7752,221,AI,153,Top - week
How many companies out there are truly experimentation focused like Netflix?,1ckulwz,"https://netflixtechblog.com/tagged/experimentation

If you check out this link you will see many articles about how much of a focus Netflix puts into experimentation. They actually explore the literature for better methods for doing large scale experimentation, and it’s a huge component of their DS workflow

However, I’m curious as to if every company is like this, because it seems like everyone else is just “okay” with taking arbitrary sample sizes, arbitrary metrics, and don’t think as critically as Netflix does about experimentation. I mean if you read their work on this blog they go as far as coming up with faster bootstrapping algorithms, sequential approaches to hypothesis testing, and really treat the design of experiments problem as the major focus where everyone else just skips that and thinks about how to build the best predictive model

What do you think of graduate student applicants?,1ci5eau,"
I am a graduate student working on Data Science. The weird thing I notice recently is that graduate schools don't teach SQL or BI tools(which makes sense because those are areas you can pretry much self learn), so a lot of graduate students are lack of those skills (me included) when applying DS or DA jobs.

But they have all the machine learning related cool-looking projects on their portfolios. So their resumes might more fit to DS roles maybe, but their lack of experiences and way less number of DS jobs stop them. Then when applying DA roles, their inadequate SQL or Bi skills stop them.

I noticed this weirdness because my friend who has several cool ML projects just failed SQL interview for DA role. I know there are many data professionals here, so wanted to ask if you have notice this where there are more graduate students applicants recently but bootcamp self learners are more fit? Now I think 6 months of bootcamp heavy focused on SQL with relavent projects could have given me more higher chances to get me DA role.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ci5eau/what_do_you_think_of_graduate_student_applicants/,Numerous-Tip-5097,116,Career Discussion,101,Top - week

How good is Capital One for a first job out of grad school?,1clled9,"Let me start out by setting some context first. I will be graduating with a Master’s degree this year from a name brand school. I have an offer to join Capital One as a Data Scientist. I went into grad school pretty much straight out of undergrad, and I don’t have any full-time experience of note going into this. 

I have some questions/thoughts, which I’d love to get some opinions on. 

1. I have been told that the role would involve modeling work and revolve around ML. Now, it’s a bank, so I’m fairly sure it’s not going to be some cutting-edge deep learning work. Most likely regressions and random forests and such, even if that? How much will this affect future opportunities going forward? Or am I just overthinking?

2. Considering it’s a bank and not exactly a tech company, am I fucked in terms of jumping to a proper tech shop a little later down the line? How favorably is C1 seen as a name on the resume in data science in particular but also within tech in general? Any insights/perspectives would be appreciated, I have absolutely no clue.

I don’t really have any other offers. A lot of fellow students I know are compromising and taking up SWE roles because they’re unable to land DS/ML roles. Others are still looking for just any offers at all. We all know the state of the job market. 

So, given all of the above, my hope is that a DS title at a fairly well-known financial services company will give me enough of a jump pad to move on to other places later. Even if this is not true, I don’t have much of an option, but I’d like some second opinions anyway. I’m too close to this to see any of it objectively.

* Are boot camps worth the investment, if so any suggestions?
* Should I aim for specific projects or portfolio examples?  (If so, any suggestions of any projects that would make me stand out would be much appreciated)
* And anything else you'd recommend?

I have a pretty non-traditional path to Data Science, I did a Bachelor of Commerce, and through a rotation program at a big Canadian bank got into a Data Science team, that was supportive and took me on despite me lacking technicals.

I've been in the position now for 2 years, mostly working with NLP and unstructured data. Doing usual Power BI dashboard, KPI antics, all the way up to using transformer embeddings for email classification models. It has been a cool role, sadly plagued with bad management, and all at a slow bank.

In recent times, the bank has gone through reorg, and we (data and analytics team)  do not have the support from senior management, nor the funding that we did maybe even a year ago. Layoffs are a small possibility, but already I feel like we have been brushed to side, with not much expectations, nor no net new projects.

Furthermore, my boss who had hired me might also be leaving, meaning I would be stuck with completely non-technical management, and I would learn nothing.

Perhaps the one good thing is the pay, but that is making it hard for me to now find a new role. My current pay is around $95K CAD + last year, a 15% bonus. With new leadership now though, that doesn't support us, I doubt we will get a bonus as fat as that anymore.

I have been interviewing with eBay for a Data Science Analyst position, working on their item buying page, and got the offer yesterday. I would report to a team in SF, but would be based in Canada. The role would be less model-building, a lot more A/B testing, from what I gathered.

**Pros of eBay:**

* Data Science at Tech company gives validity to my otherwise non-technical resume (academically, at least)
* 1 week in office and flexibility to work from abroad (according to HR); so I can travel home internationally and not burn PTO, compared to 3 in office and no flexibility currently
* Hopefully newer tech stack than the bank (fr we don't even have a SQL server set up here lmfao)
* Been with the bank for 3 years in various roles, really tired and fed up, so would be a good change and refresh
* 20K sign on for first year, 10K sign on second year, conditional to me staying for a year after receiving bonuses, in addition to equity discount purchase options, and $30K USD equity package (25%/year vest) in compensation

**Cons:**

* Only a 10% base-pay bump. Tech homies (though in SF) tell me to not settle for anything less than 20% bump between jobs.
* Not building models as much, which makes it more statistics-focused and less applied
* 80% focused on A/B testing from what I gathered
* Unsure of eBay market reputation these days, what are some companies that people end up working at after eBay?
* High rate of layoffs

In addition to all of this, I am interviewing with Intuit and Robinhood, both for more technical Data Science positions. Those would likely pay in the 120K-140K CAD range from what I understand, eBay would be at 105k.

The next step for these interviews would be the technicals, which I do not feel confident for at all (Python, SQL LeetCode Mediums + statistics and ML design questions). I haven't studied for this stuff that much, and would really be cramming.

I have told eBay that I can let them know on Monday if the compensation is okay, I am tempted to go back to them and beg for $110K CAD, which would be a 15% bump, and mention that I am interested in the role, but the pay is just not working for me, especially that I am interviewing for two other positions that may pay better. So I want to request if I can continue the interview process with the other two, and get back to eBay with a final confirmation. Not sure how to phrase this, or if I should even show my hand like that.  
eBay HR was really nice, really felt like they were gunning for me, and the offer felt like the max they could squeeze out between Payroll and the Hiring team.

I'm just confused. In light of all of this, where can/should I go?

I was 65% in favour to take, 35% to reject, but given my friends/family advice that the pay is low and not worth moving, I am unsure.

I'm also not sure how to buy myself time for the interveiws with RH and Intuit, and god if I can even do them.

Is it really that bad to move for 10% base bump? Ignoring sign-on bonus, equity, quality of life?

Lastly, I'm not sure if eBay is a boost to my career or a step down; is it a good place to work? Is it frowned upon by other companies as a ""legacy tech company"" or something?

Impact of different tool use on future job prospects,1cjzsxi,"I'm in a senior DS role right now. This is my first data job after being a professor for a few years post PhD. I'm a modeler, that's my main focus on the job, which I absolutely love. 

However, the client (I'm a consultant) uses SAS miner and guide, and does not use Python at all. Partially because they always have and partially for security concerns. As I build my models, realistically the biggest issue is making sure I do things that our (imo outdated) tech stack can handle.

Learn how to add value with AI to dinosuar companies,1cnb8o7,"Just had a big meeting for the data team at my company (big pharma). They kept saying ""AI first company"" and ""save money through AI"" and ""improve productivity with AI"" etc. However, when I stood up to ask what they were planning on to implement this they had very little top-down ideas, probably due to a lack of understanding of the tech or no direct incentives to do so. Instead it seemed like the employees would generate ideas and figure out how to engineer it. 

  
Where I'm going with this is that if you're trying to break into the field or stand out this is a great opportunity. the leadership typically doesn't know what use cases exist for AI or how to measure it. If you can sell yourself like this on a resume/interview it seems like a good way to stand out. So taking a AI application and use case from begining to end seems like a new potential backdoor to get some attention. Also showing that you're the guy that can provide a method to show that the use case is effective (since they don't yet know how to measure impact). Being able to do this demonstrates business knowledge, tech skills, engineering, etc. and is a buzzword people love. Im still not sure if recruiters are instructed to look for these things, but in a networking setting its definitely $$$$.

Am I really a Data Analyst?,1clqh1h,"Hello everyone. It is my first post here, but I read this subreddit nearly each day as a way to understand more about this world. So, first of all, nice to contact you, dudes.

My question refers to the exact nature of the rol I am currently playing in a company. So, let me explain (TL;DR at the end of the post, here just the long explanation):

* **My background**: I'm a Psychology Bachelor, with two Ms. in Criminology and a third one in Methodology and Statistics. Contrary to the majority in my country (studying criminology in Spain is interesting, but it's horrible to find a job with that), I was able to enrole with a Computer Science research team from a very famous university in Spain, where I started analyzing online profiles to participate in research (both from a NLP and a bit of SNA perspective). As I was very very interested on Data Analysis and statistics (I'm not a very good statician, but at least I am really interested on it and happy to learn and study new things), they convinced me to do a PhD in Computer Science (which was focused on that topic, classic NLP and SNA to study social data online). With a lot of effort, I finished it and continued working on Academia till a year ago, when I was so burned out of several things of Spanish academia that I decided to start looking for new jobs. My environment always told me that my profile was quite interesting, but I had lot of problems trying to get interviews, as my profile is, as we say in Spain, ""an apprendice of everything, but master of none"" (I think that, in English, is "" Jack of *all trades*, *master of none* "". But, after a few months, I found a company focused on social data analysis projects that interviewed me and gave me an offer.
* **The original interview + offer**: they interviewed me for a Data Analyst position (nor junior, nor senior). The interview was a first one with HR, asking about my general CV, and then with a team manager and a ""senior"" data analyst. The interview was waaaaaaay too easy. They shared their screen and showed me a dataset on Excel, and asked me very simple things about it (e.g. what can you tell me about this pattern, what would you do to extract information from this couple of variables, how would you deal with missing data, etc). For me, it was a relief, as I've been working a lot at academia and wanted to have something easier to do, at least for some time. I guess they were interested on me, as they decided to gave me an offer (data analyst, 32K€, better salary than in academia, and FULL remote work, which was ideal for me since I prefered to go back from Madrid to a little city in the coast of Spain, with family and friends). I accepted without any doubts, and left academia.
* **The problem: I've been working three months for that company. In the beginning, I thought I would work as ""simple"" dat**a analyst on Excel (in, let's say, more or less ""structured"" projects). However, they told me that, due to my profile, they preferred me to be involved in ""innovation"" projects, which sounded interesting. On those projects, I'm working with a single manager, which is in contact with the client and tells me what type of analysis he wants on the pipeline, which I build in Python, translating every idea he tells me into ""regular"" analysis. For the built of that pipeline, I need knowledge on Python (they did not ask me to test my skills on Python during the interview), SQL (same), NLP (same), SNA (same), a little bit of PowerBI (same) and a little bit of Excel (this was the only thing covered). Also, each time I tell the manager that an analysis is too complicated and there is another way to deal with the idea he has, he always discards my idea and tells me to do it they way he wants. Most of the times, this means a lot of hours wasted, and no apologies. Also, another manager told me that he wanted me to ""guide"" the rest of the data analysts of the company, which are more junior than me, and structure a whole ""data analysis"" department. I thought that meant that I would work as a... lead data analyst? But they told me that was just dealing with internal projects with all the data analysts to improve general analysis for future projects. I said that was OK for me (I know is naive, but is my first data analyst job outside academia and, to be honest, I'm interested on leading a team). However, usually data analysts are required to be involved on company projects 110% of the time (most of the time doing extra hours), and this means that, each time I distribute work among us and we meet in 4-5 days, no one was able to advance on it due to other duties of the company (each manager wants their work to be absolute priority). Also, interestingly, the other data analysts do usually work with Excel and PowerBI, using Python just in rare occassions.

TL;DR: Bachelor in Psychology, 2 Ms. in Criminology, 1 Ms. in Statistics, PhD in Computer Science, low-medium knowledge in Python (most of the time using chatGPT and adapting the code), low knowledge SQL, regular skills with Excel and PowerBI, good knowledge of statistics. In the company, they want me to be ""lead"" without saying I am the ""lead"" data analyst (kind of...informal?), with no clear duties regarding that ""lead"" beyond organizing small projects with the other data analysts to improve the general performance of company projects, and usually dealing with programming, NLP and SNA to adapt the ideas of a manager to ""actual"" analysis into a pipeline.

**So, the question is... am I really a Data Analyst?**

Bootstrap Procedure for Max,1cmjlvx,"Hello my fellow DS/stats peeps,

I am working on a new problem where I am dealing with 15 years worth of hourly data of average website clicks. On a given day, I am interested in estimating the peak volume of clicks on a website with a 95% confidence interval. The way I am going about this is by bootstrapping my data 10,000 times for each day but I am not sure if I am doing this right or it might not even be possible.

Procedure looks as follows:

* Group all Jan 1, Jan 2,… Dec 31 into daily buckets. So I have 15 years worth of hourly data for each of these days, or 360 data points (15\*24).
* For a single day bucket (take Jan 1), I sample 24 values (to mimic the 24 hour day) from the 1/1 bucket to create a resampled day, store the max during each resampling. I do this process 10,000 times for each day.
   * At this point, I have 10,000 bootstrapped maxes for all days of the year.

This is where I get a little lost. If I take the .975 and .025 of the 10,000 bootstrapped maxes for each day, in theory these should be my 95% bands of where the max should live. When I bootstrap my max point estimate by taking the max of the 10,000 samples, it’s the same as my upper confidence band.

Am I missing something theoretical or maybe my procedure is off? I’ve never bootstrapped a max or maybe it is not something that is even recommended/possible to do.

They delved much deeper, which is fine, I suppose it helps figuring out right away if the candidate has at least the specific knowledge before they try to test it. But after that the recruiter stated that the interview process was over several days, as they like to go quick:

 - 1.5 hours long interview with the HM
 - 1.5 hours long interview focusing on coding + general data science.
 - 1.5 hours long interview focusing on machine learning.
 - 1.5 hour long interview with the entire team, general aspect questions.
 - 1 hour long interview with the VP of data science.


So between the 7 hours and the initial 45 minutes, I am expected to miss the equivalent of an entire day of work, so they can ask me unclear questions or on issues unrelated to work.


I told the recruiter, I need to bow out and this is too much. It would feel like I insulted the entire lineage of the company after I said that. They started talking about how that's their process, and it is the same for all companies to require this sort of vetting. Which to be clear, there is no managing people, I am still an individual recruiter. I just told them that's unreasonable, and good luck finding a candidate.

Job hunt update.,1c6p6m4,"I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/s/5MjMTDtBYB) after getting an offer a couple months ago. A couple weeks after the offer, it was rescinded. Probably for the best as I realized the original description did not match the actual role.

After the offer was rescinded, I took a couple weeks off the job hunt before getting back at it. Cleaned up the resume, started being more selective with where I applied, and grinding SQL problems online. About a month in I was interviewing with 3 companies. 

I don't feel like making another Sankey, but it's pretty much identical to the last, except I got 3 first round interviews, rather than the 1 last time. Companies are 1 mid-sized tech and 2 pre-IPO unicorns. I was ghosted by one unicorn after a screening round and am still interviewing with the other after 2 rounds, though after 5 rounds with the mid-sized tech I accepted a DS manager position.

My advice: 1) stop following this subreddit, it's 90% doom posting and 10% circle jerk. It doesn't feel like anyone here is actually interested in data science beyond getting a job. 2) mass send an easy to parse resume everywhere. 3) keep your head up, it's a grind. Don't forget to exercise, eat well, and have a social outlet. 4) referrals aren't worth what they once were. None of my dozen or so referrals resulted in even a screening interview 

I was rejected for roles I thought I was a shoo-in for and interviewed for roles I thought were a reach. There's a lot of luck (preparation+opportunity) involved that's often out of your control.

Am I a coding Imposter?,1c8ru38,"Hello DS fellows,

I've been working in the Data Science space for 7+ years now (was in a different career before that).  However, I continue to feel very inadequate to the point that I constantly have this imposter syndrome about my coding skills that I want to ask for your opinions/feedback.

Despite my 7+ years of writing codes and scripting in Python, I still have to look up the syntax 70% - 80% of the times on the internet when I do my projects.  The problem is that I have hard time remembering the syntax.  Because of this, most of the times I just copy and paste code chunks from my previous works and then modify them;  yet even when doing modification I still have to look up the syntax on the internet if something new is needed to add.

I have coded in C and C++ in the past and I suffered the same problem but it was for short periods of time so I didn't think anything about it back then.

Besides this, I don't have any issues with solving complicated problems because I tend to understand the math/stats very well and derive solution plans for them.  But when it comes to coding it up, I find myself looking up the syntax too often even when I have been using Python for 7+ years now (average about 1-2 coding times per week).

I feel very embarrassed about this particular short-coming and want to ask 2 questions:

1. Is this normal for those with similar length of experience?
2. If this is not normal, how can I improve?

Appreciate the responses and feedbacks!

=========  
**Update:**  Thanks everyone for your responses.  This now seems like a common problem for most.  To clarify, I don't need to look up simple syntax when coding in Python.  It's the syntax of the functions in the libraries/packages that I struggle to memorize them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c8ru38/am_i_a_coding_imposter/,VDtrader,242,Coding,152,Top - month

AI startup debuts “hallucination-free” and causal AI for enterprise data analysis and decision support,1clkibc,"https://venturebeat.com/ai/exclusive-alembic-debuts-hallucination-free-ai-for-enterprise-data-analysis-and-decision-support/

Artificial intelligence startup Alembic announced today it has developed a new AI system that it claims completely eliminates the generation of false information that plagues other AI technologies, a problem known as “hallucinations.” In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Alembic co-founder and CEO Tomás Puig revealed that the company is introducing the new AI today in a keynote presentation at the Forrester B2B Summit and will present again next week at the Gartner CMO Symposium in London.

The key breakthrough, according to Puig, is the startup’s ability to use AI to identify causal relationships, not just correlations, across massive enterprise datasets over time. “We basically immunized our GenAI from ever hallucinating,” Puig told VentureBeat. “It is deterministic output. It can actually talk about cause and effect.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1clkibc/ai_startup_debuts_hallucinationfree_and_causal_ai/,Heavy-Painting-7752,219,AI,153,Top - month

We run an online sales portal with a multitude of variables that can lead to changes in our KPIs. A lot of the functioning of these variables are not well documented. The sources I’m expected to go to in order to find my explanations are a mix of already-created Tableau and PBI dashboards, some more bespoke internal systems (same dynamic as a dashboard basically), maybe some SQL querying against Redshift, and my own intuition. That’s it. No modeling, no experimentation, no Python unless I make an explicit decision to spend time writing something, and no longterm projects besides maybe building more dashboards to help explain things even faster. I’m pretty slow now as this sort of work relies heavily on familiarity with what dashboard/report to go to for what and how everything ties together but just feels like I might be in the wrong spot.

What realistically will be automated in the next 5 years for data scientists / ML engineers? Plus would love some career advice,1c1vciv,"Recently I’ve been job hunting and have hit the sad realization that I’ll have to take a salary cut if I want to work for a company with good ML practices. I have a lot of student loans from master’s program. 

I’ve been trying to keep up with LLM coding automations and software automators. It’s all beginning to seriously make me anxious but I think the probability I’m overreacting is at least 50%.

How much of a data scientist’s job do you think will be completely automated? Do you think we (recent master’s graduates with lots of debt) made the wrong choice? What areas can I strengthen to begin to future proof myself? Should I just chill out and just be ready to learn and adapt continuously?

My thinking is that I want to do more ML engineering or ML infra engineering even though right now I’m just a data scientist. It feels like this career path will pay off my loans, have some security, and also is better than dealing with business stakeholders sometimes. 

I am considering taking a bad pay cut to do more sophisticated ML where I’ll be building more scalable models and dealing with models in production. My thought process is this is the path to ML engineer. However my anxiety is terrifying me. Should I just not take the pay cut and continue to pay off loans + wait for a new opportunity? I fear the longer I wait, the worse my skills at a bad company become. Also would rather take a pay hit now and not in 1 year.

 My fear with taking pay cut is that I’ll be broke for a year and then in another year automations and coding bots might really become sophisticated. 

Anyways, if anyone’s knowledgeable would love to chat. This market and my loans are the most depressing realization ever

Why is it so hard to get neural networks to beat XGBoost on most small-medium tabular datasets?,1c10pqe,"I get it; XGBoost is really potent and easy to use while with DL theres a lot more that can go wrong tuning hyper parameters wise.

But i always assumed that whatever an ML model can do, a DL model with proper settings and sufficient regularization can also do as well even in low-medium size datsets (~hundreds to thoussnds of examples range).

I understand that DL models are more likely to overfit because theyre very very flexible espeically especially as width and parameter count goes up. Meanwhile, something like XGBoost tends to have just enough flexibioity to model complex patterns without overfitting.

At the same time, i thought that with sufficient regularization techniques like dropout, L1/L2, shrinking width etc, that a DL model should be able to generalize just as well even with small-medium datasets. 

Is it just that I havent found the correct combination of regularization and layer architecture? Or is it just that my assumption is wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c10pqe/why_is_it_so_hard_to_get_neural_networks_to_beat/,WhiteRaven_M,138,Discussion,88,Top - month
How big of a jump is it from Data Scientist to ML Engineer?,1c79bse,"I'm considering applying for a Machine Learning Engineer position with my company. I already work as a Data Scientist. I've developed a great reputation and most of the executives know who I am and frequently ask for my input on things. I'm happy with my job, but unfortunately, it feels a bit dead-end'ish. It's a great job, don't get me wrong, but I don't see any obvious path to promotion, short of waiting it out 10 years and that frustrates me a lot. 

There are more long-term opportunities in ML Engineering in my company. Salary should be a bit higher as well; I'm estimating I'd make at least $25k more. 

As a DS, I mostly work with Python, SQL, and Tableau. I'd say only about 20% of my time is spent coding, however. I've built a few machine learning models (mostly time-series and collaborative filtering), but it's not the main crux of what I do. Still, I'm pretty universally regarded as the expert on ML as well as tech on the team. Moreover, I've automated a lot of our analysis. I'd be considered an expert on SQL and data analysis, as well. 

If I switch to MLE, I'd also need to become proficient in Databricks, Azure, and React. I don't work with any of those on a regular basis (I've used Azure and Databricks before, but not a lot). I'm guessing I'd probably go from coding maybe 20% of the time to coding 70%+ of the time, as well. React is probably the toughest one there, but I do have front-end experience from working as a full-stack developer at a start-up a few years back; albeit, I'd consider myself very far from an expert on front-end. 

I'd be very good at it, but I admit it might take me 1-2 months to ""get into a groove"" and get comfortable with some of the technologies I'm less familiar with, particularly React. I learn quickly, but I often feel like people want take a chance on anyone who doesn't already know every skill in the job requirement. 

My questions:

**How big of a jump is this?** I don't use Databricks on a regular basis, but given my proficiency in Python and SQL, is that going to be something that would take a long time to get familiar with? Is my relative inexperience in React a big issue or is it just so difficult to find an ML Engineer with React experience to begin with, that I might get a pass on that? 

**Is it worthwhile?** Anyone who has worked on both the business-facing DS side and the more tech-oriented ML side, did you enjoy one more than the other? 

**Am I likely to get serious consideration?** I have a very good reputation within the company, but often feels like some of the more pure tech people look down on someone more business-facing like myself. I'm not sure how I'll be perceived, since my background was business before I got into tech.

I am a graduate student working on Data Science.

But they have all the machine learning related cool-looking projects on their portfolios. So their resumes might more fit to DS roles maybe, but their lack of experiences and way less number of DS jobs stop them. Then when applying DA roles, their inadequate SQL or Bi skills stop them.

I noticed this weirdness because my friend who has several cool ML projects just failed SQL interview for DA role.

I have degrees in math and stats, and gotten good grades, so it's not like I am bad at it. And I actually liked these in school. But in my career, I am not really enjoying that aspect anymore, and want to just focus on engineering and building stuff. I no longer care about reading up on statistical models and ML papers. I get that Attention is all I need, but I no longer care to pay attention to Attention, if you get my drift.

So I am looking to leave data science and ML and pivot towards an adjacent engineering role, something like data engineering, MLOps, analytics engineering, platform engineering and the like. At the same time, I feel like AI/ML is the future and will explode in demand very soon, if it isn't already there. Perhaps it's fomo or feeling that my education in math/stats have gone to waste, but there is a part of me that feels like I am downgrading or moving down the career ladder by doing this. I also see most people trying to move \*towards\* ML so I feel like I am doing something wrong by making such a move.

I am wondering if anybody has faced something similar before and pivoted completely towards engineering rather than the ML model development and stats side (e.g. the ""sexy"" parts of data science). If you did, I would like to hear your story. What made you transition to an engineering focus? And do you regret it? Do you think you will eventually go back to ML/AI side or stay in engineering?

Why Aren't Boilerplates More Common in DS?,1cb3p6o,"I've been working as a DS in predictive analytics a good amount of years now, and recently I've been pushed to dig a bit more on the more data viz side, which eeeehh fortunately or unfortunately meant coding web-dev stuff. I have realized that in the web-dev side, there are a shit ton of people building and consuming boilerplates. Like for real, a mind-blowing amount of demand for such things that I would not have expected in my life.

However, I've never seen anything similar for DS projects. Sure, there's decent documentation and examples in most libraries, but it's still far from the convenience of a boilerplate.

Talking to a mate he was like, I'm sure in web-dev everything is more standard than DS, and I'm like... man have you seen how many frameworks, backends, styling clusterfuck of technologies is out there. So I don't think standardization is the reason here. Do you guys think there is a gap in DS when it comes to this kind of things? Any ideas why is not more widespread? Am I missing something all toghether?

Data Science is fun!,1c7bw30,"Hi everyone, I’m a marketing major about to graduate in May. A year and a half ago I took basic hypothesis testing/linear modeling class to try out an analytics certificate at my school, and I fell in love with statistics for the first time. When I began looking for job/internship opportunities around that time I was worried because while I didn’t mind marketing, I also didn’t love it. That’s when I made the decision to continue my degree in business, and work every week towards becoming a data analyst (and eventually, a data scientist! But I’m patient, and I wanted to wait until I’m ready. There’s a lot to statistics/programming, as I now know… lol). 

It’s been a long and *very* hard road. But I now have a job as a data analyst and I’m working on a large machine learning personal project now. I see a lot of negative discussion in this sub (which is entirely fair); however, I just wanted you all to know that as someone who is not taking the traditional route into data science, I think your job is awesome.

[Discussion] My boss asked me to give a presentation about - AI for data-science,1bz564f,"I'm a data-scientist at a small company (around 30 devs and 7 data-scientists, plus sales, marketing, management etc.). Our job is mainly classic tabular data-science stuff with a bit of geolocation data. Lots of statistics and some ML pipelines model training.

After a little talk we had about using ChatGPT and Github Copilot my boss (the head of the data-science team) decided that in order to make sure that we are not missing useful tool and in order not to stay behind he wants me (as the one with a Ph.D. in the group I guess) to make a little research about what possibilities does AI tools bring to the data-science role and I should present my finding and insights in a month from now.

From what I've seen in my field so far LLMs are way better at NLP tasks and when dealing with tabular data and plain statistics they tend to be less reliable to say the least. Still, on such a fast evolving area I might be missing something. Besides that, as I said, those gaps might get bridged sooner or later and so it feels like a good practice to stay updated even if the SOTA is still immature.

So - what is your take? What tools other than using ChatGPT and Copilot to generate python code should I look into? Are there any relevant talks, courses, notebooks, or projects that you would recommend? Additionally, if you have any hands-on project ideas that could help our team experience these tools firsthand, I'd love to hear them.

How good is Capital One for a first job out of grad school?,1clled9,"Let me start out by setting some context first. I will be graduating with a Master’s degree this year from a name brand school. I have an offer to join Capital One as a Data Scientist. I went into grad school pretty much straight out of undergrad, and I don’t have any full-time experience of note going into this. 

I have some questions/thoughts, which I’d love to get some opinions on. 

1. I have been told that the role would involve modeling work and revolve around ML. Now, it’s a bank, so I’m fairly sure it’s not going to be some cutting-edge deep learning work. Most likely regressions and random forests and such, even if that? How much will this affect future opportunities going forward? Or am I just overthinking?

2. Considering it’s a bank and not exactly a tech company, am I fucked in terms of jumping to a proper tech shop a little later down the line? How favorably is C1 seen as a name on the resume in data science in particular but also within tech in general? Any insights/perspectives would be appreciated, I have absolutely no clue.

I don’t really have any other offers. A lot of fellow students I know are compromising and taking up SWE roles because they’re unable to land DS/ML roles. Others are still looking for just any offers at all. We all know the state of the job market. 

So, given all of the above, my hope is that a DS title at a fairly well-known financial services company will give me enough of a jump pad to move on to other places later. Even if this is not true, I don’t have much of an option, but I’d like some second opinions anyway. I’m too close to this to see any of it objectively.

LLMs: Why does in-context learning work? What exactly is happening from a technical perspective?,1cdii27,"Everywhere I look for the answer to this question, the responses do little more than anthropomorphize the model. They invariably make claims like:

> *Without examples, the model must infer context and rely on its knowledge to deduce what is expected. This could lead to misunderstandings.*

> *One-shot prompting reduces this cognitive load by offering a specific example, helping to anchor the model's interpretation and focus on a narrower task with clearer expectations.*

> *The example serves as a reference or hint for the model, helping it understand the type of response you are seeking and triggering memories of similar instances during training.*

> *Providing an example allows the model to identify a pattern or structure to replicate. It establishes a cue for the model to align with, reducing the guesswork inherent in zero-shot scenarios.*

These are real excerpts, btw.

But these models don’t “understand” anything. They don’t “deduce”, or “interpret”, or “focus”, or “remember training”, or “make guesses”, or have literal “cognitive load”. They are just statistical token generators. Therefore pop-sci explanations like these are kind of meaningless when seeking a concrete understanding of the exact mechanism by which in-context learning improves accuracy.

Can someone offer an explanation that explains things in terms of the actual model architecture/mechanisms and how the provision of additional context leads to better output? I can “talk the talk”, so spare no technical detail please.

I could make an educated guess - Including examples in the input which use tokens that approximate the kind of output you want leads the attention mechanism and final dense layer to weight more highly tokens which are similar in some way to these examples, increasing the odds that these desired tokens will be sampled at the end of each forward pass; like fundamentally I’d guess it’s a similarity/distance thing, where explicitly exemplifying the output I want increases the odds that the output get will be similar to it - but I’d prefer to hear it from someone else with deep knowledge of these models and mechanisms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cdii27/llms_why_does_incontext_learning_work_what/,synthphreak,54,ML,39,Top - month

I’m in a masters stats position program and even though I’m doing well in the coursework, I rarely get to actually “DO” any of the things I’m learning. 

Like for example in my statistical inference theory class we spend like a week covering how to find rejection regions for hypothesis tests by hand using likelihood ratio tests, and then just do these derivations constantly. Same in my bayes class.

Lately, I have been reading the research posted by tech companies, where they talk about what data scientists are doing out there in the real world, and the statistical methods that are being created and leveraged, and they are actually putting what they learn into practice and get so much creativity and freedom.

I’m frankly just looking forward to graduate and work because I’m so tired of not actually doing the real stuff and solving real problems. I’m hoping there’s more creativity fostered as oppose to a classroom. Does anyone feel this way about masters programs sometimes?

Anyone have experience working in a healthcare start-up?,1ci00ps,"I (27) was just recently reached out by a healthcare start-up for a Senior DS role and will be starting the interview process. I've only worked in large healthcare companies, one of them being a hospital system, in analytical work. While it's early in the interview process, the lowest side of their payband is \~$60K more than I make now. But in my current position, I have a very hands off manager, my manager is a big advocate for good work life balance, work at my own pace 99% of the time, and most weeks work 25-30 hours a week which lets me do my own hobbies through out the week. The one thing that is lacking though is the projects I work on aren't very difficult (read mostly ad-hoc reporting via excel and SQL) and I don't feel like I'm growing my skillsets.

I figure that a start-up space is going to be much more faster paced and a lot less work-life balance, but on the flip side I'll (assumingly) will be working on more exciting projects that will actually teach me new things. 

Just wanted some perspective from people who are in the start-up space. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ci00ps/anyone_have_experience_working_in_a_healthcare/,nollange_,33,Career Discussion,33,Top - month
Capitulation | It's come to this,1c0zhd5,"wayy TLDR: 2023 Statistics, Finance, and Math grad with only one internship in tangentially related role. Can't find a job going on well over a year. Located in the US and is mostly location agnostic with a few preferences. Just trying all my options.

Hello, all. I sit here writing this post in disbelief that I am actuall doing this. Generally, in any given subreddit, I am a lurker. A year ago I would have shuddered at the thought of making a post like this. It goes against my nature to ask (beg?) for help from stangers--or, even from anybody at times. I feel as if I've done everything I can and am going insane trying to figure out where I am going wrong. Confiding in my close friend, I spoke of my troubles and experience in my job search (how I had done everything possible and such), and he suggested I make a post to this subreddit. To his credit, I had not done this yet and decided to exhaust all options I know of. I don't know what to expect, but I hope at the very least a see a perspective that allows me to push past the feelings (of what I can't really pinpoint anymore but despair, desperation, and any others you can name are probably there too).

This is my first post of this nature; so, being not sure of how to start, I will begin with an overview of myself and then attempt to consruct a coherent description of my situation. Details of the biography aren't unique to me or necessarily important to understanding my struggles, but, for anyone interested I figured it would save a few additional comments that I may have to make to give them.

I come from a very rural, impoverished area. Both my parents grew up even poorer than we are now, and neither went to college. My dad is a first-generation American so his life story has been quite rough as the family got here in the early 20th century (he is very old compared to my classmates fathers). I was lucky enough to have been born to two wonderful people who supported me in any way they could although not fully understanding the life I wanted--one away from poverty and where I could explore my interests with like-minded people. Luckily, I did exceptionally well in academics and found myself with an acceptance to a top ten undergrad program.

My thoughts (however misguided as there was no one I could have advise on this in highschool) were to go where the money was. Wallstreet. I had set out on studying finance my freshman year. My school  sends countless kids to the top Investment Banks every year and I thought that I should do that, get paid, find myself, and then transition to what ever industry I could if I wanted out. The school paid for a trek out to NYC and we got to go and visit all the big banks and meet with emloyees it was really fun. That was until someone told me about the work culture. This was the 2nd or third month of my freshman year so I was pretty ignorant with most things and when told about the working hours my stomach dropped. It seemed inhuman to work that much and for the price it didnt seem worth it. I struggled with this for a while and really started to enjoy the statistics class I was in. I'm sure you can guess where the rest of that story goes. I ended up switching to statistics; however, I still greatly enoyed finance and the classes were super interesting, so I kept finance for my other major. I also took several math classes past whats required for the minor but not quite the major but I enjoyed them regardless. I got to intern at INSEAD in Paris for a summer as a research assistant in statistics, so I thought I had a good chance to get some sort of data analyst/scientist/etc. role going into my senior year. Being an IB feeder school many of my classmates and friends had fulltime offers already and many more were expecting theres upon completing their upcoming internship. I however got nothing. I couldnt even find a professor that I could work for over the summer.

I went through junior summer jobless and scared. Everyone told me I would find a full time offer before graduating, but I didn't. I didn't care if it was for data/business analyst or data science or marketing data analyst etc. etc.

I was then graduated living at home with no income. My student loans (though very low) still were there and I began having to pay on those. There is no job I can get near me. I never had a car growing up and still dont. We just never had the money for that.

Luckily, there is an amazing alumni network that is always willing to help. Additonally, one of my professors I'm close with has made some good connections for me putting me in contact with some fantastic people who have helped me with interview prep, resume advice/editing, etc. The only thing they couldn't do is give me a referral as, upon looking there were no entry level roles for me that were open.

All of this was going on as I had life happening (as it does haha) This past summer I experienced the death of a close friend, a grandparent, and many other things. Job rejection and ghost after the other just hurt. I was lucky enough to a have a few go to an interview where I got to present my analysis to a team. Now they wont respond to my emails. It feels like some jobs just try to use applicants for free ideas without ever hiring them. Then, one day my girlfriend of 11 months facetimed me saying that she ""thinks it would be best if we didnt talk anymore"". I heard later through a friend that one of the reasons was my lack of ambition since i ""didn't even have a job yet and have the \[prestige of my undergrad\] to back me up"". Long story short, I did something very stupid and tried to take my life, but was stopped by cops who had been notified of a ""distressed person"". I was allowed to 201 myself and 2500 of my savings later, some therapy, and several months later, I feel much better and in control, but the frustration of getting a job still is there. I don't know what to do. I feel like I see everyone saying that referrals are the best way to get a job, which makes sense, but I have very excellent alumni helping and its still not doing it for me. Everyone I graduated with is on wallstreet now or at some consulting firm being overworked, but I just want to work. I like working I want to be sucessful. I sometimes wish I had just stayed with the crowd and not been such a baby about the working hours.

Looking at what I've written I realize it has gotten quite long. I don't want to be annoying, but I promised my friend I would do this. The simple act of posting this brings me much peace as I have exhausted this option. I'm not a big reddit poster/user, so apologies if I broke some unspoken rule or something of this sub. I wont exlain anymore in this initial post but will be happy to answer any commens or dms. I hope that this is somewhat coherent but writing it brought back a lot of memories I don't like to think of, so I did my best to get past it and just have something written down.

I just finished my first year of uni as a Data Science major.

To get ahead, I'm ready to dedicate my next 3–4 months to building skills, being a student I don't have a big budget but ready to spend a few hundreds at most if there's something that sounds like a must-do.

I've looked over a few courses on Udemy and Coursera, started the IBM Data Science Certifications, although not 100% sure what else to go for.

* Should I focus on a specialized online course?
* Are boot camps worth the investment, if so any suggestions?
* Should I aim for specific projects or portfolio examples?  (If so, any suggestions of any projects that would make me stand out would be much appreciated)
* And anything else you'd recommend?

Anything to set me up to get a good internship next year, or that'll generally build up my resume, would be amazing! I don't go to a Russel group Uni. So I know I'd need to work a little harder than some.

Developments outside the world of LLMs and GenAI,1c7k28c," Hi everyone, 

I want to know if there are developments and research topics that are outside/completely orthogonal to LLMs and generative AI. To be honest, I am **bored** of LLMs. I don't care about the performance of Model X vs Models A,B,C,D etc. Moreover, at least 8 out of 10 projects in my organization are focused on generative AI and RAG. While I understand the usefulness of these ideas, I think there's an overload of information that is not particularly helpful for my brain.

Personally, I am interested in scientific machine learning- drug discovery, climate change, physics simulations. If there are other research areas that you are aware of, please feel free to share. 

From a ""long term career perspective"", I want to transition to companies that work on problems in imaging and communications (I have a background in signal/image processing and computer vision). I am very much interested in novel imaging techniques that use some kind of computational imaging and ML algorithms.

Enhancing Weather Forecast Accuracy: Exploring Regression Models with Multi-source Data Integration,1c30flh,"I am currently working as a data scientist at a new energy startup, mainly responsible for predicting photovoltaic power generation every 15 minutes for the next day. The key data relied upon are weather forecasts, especially the predicted solar irradiance values. Currently, we have data from five numerical weather forecasts, which include fields such as irradiance, temperature, and humidity. The accuracy of the forecasts varies among different data sources, and there are certain discrepancies with the actual weather. I am considering merging the five sets of data to obtain a more accurate weather forecast. Can I use a regression model to fit the actual weather using the five sets of weather forecast data? Is there a better method available?

Btw, the weather forecast datasets appears as follows:

"Learning OOP, stick with Python or learn using Java",1c6siuu,"I’m starting a Master’s program in the fall and I’d like to improve my programming skills.

I’ve never actually learned about OOP or say structures and algorithms but I’d like to. I’ve read a bunch about Java being a more rigorous language which forces you to code in an object-oriented way.

What's next for the quintessential DS role?,1c25koq,"This post is multiple questions wrapped into a single topic kind of thing which is why I thought best to keep it as an open-ended discussion.

  
**Q1.** When I see recent DS job postings a majority now have these two added requirements: 1. Some knowledge of LLMs. 2. Experience in NLP. I'm not sure if this is just biased based on what LinkedIn algorithm is showing me. But is this the direction that the average DS role is headed? I've always considered myself as a jack of all trades, flexible DS, but with no expertise is any technical vertical. Is the demand for the general data scientist role diminishing?  
  
**Q2.** In my 5 years of experience as a DS I've worked on descriptive analytics, predictive modelling, dash-boarding in consulting and product alike. Now, 5 years isn't that much time, but it's not too short either. I'm now finding myself working on similar types of problems (churn, risk, forecasting) and similar tools and workflows. This is not a complaint by any means, it is expected. But this got me thinking... Are there new tools and workflows out there that might enhance my current working setup?  For example: I sometimes find myself struggling to manage code for different variations of datasets used for different model versions. After loads of experimentation my directory is a mess. I'd love to know tools and workflows you use for typical DS problems.

Moving to eBay as a Data Science Analyst?,1ck5fiy,"Hey all, firstly, I don't want to sound disingenuous so I really hope this doesn't come off that way.

I have a pretty non-traditional path to Data Science, I did a Bachelor of Commerce, and through a rotation program at a big Canadian bank got into a Data Science team, that was supportive and took me on despite me lacking technicals.

I've been in the position now for 2 years, mostly working with NLP and unstructured data. Doing usual Power BI dashboard, KPI antics, all the way up to using transformer embeddings for email classification models. It has been a cool role, sadly plagued with bad management, and all at a slow bank.

In recent times, the bank has gone through reorg, and we (data and analytics team)  do not have the support from senior management, nor the funding that we did maybe even a year ago. Layoffs are a small possibility, but already I feel like we have been brushed to side, with not much expectations, nor no net new projects.

Furthermore, my boss who had hired me might also be leaving, meaning I would be stuck with completely non-technical management, and I would learn nothing.

Perhaps the one good thing is the pay, but that is making it hard for me to now find a new role. My current pay is around $95K CAD + last year, a 15% bonus. With new leadership now though, that doesn't support us, I doubt we will get a bonus as fat as that anymore.

I have been interviewing with eBay for a Data Science Analyst position, working on their item buying page, and got the offer yesterday. I would report to a team in SF, but would be based in Canada. The role would be less model-building, a lot more A/B testing, from what I gathered.

**Pros of eBay:**

* Data Science at Tech company gives validity to my otherwise non-technical resume (academically, at least)
* 1 week in office and flexibility to work from abroad (according to HR); so I can travel home internationally and not burn PTO, compared to 3 in office and no flexibility currently
* Hopefully newer tech stack than the bank (fr we don't even have a SQL server set up here lmfao)
* Been with the bank for 3 years in various roles, really tired and fed up, so would be a good change and refresh
* 20K sign on for first year, 10K sign on second year, conditional to me staying for a year after receiving bonuses, in addition to equity discount purchase options, and $30K USD equity package (25%/year vest) in compensation

**Cons:**

* Only a 10% base-pay bump. Tech homies (though in SF) tell me to not settle for anything less than 20% bump between jobs.
* Not building models as much, which makes it more statistics-focused and less applied
* 80% focused on A/B testing from what I gathered
* Unsure of eBay market reputation these days, what are some companies that people end up working at after eBay?
* High rate of layoffs

In addition to all of this, I am interviewing with Intuit and Robinhood, both for more technical Data Science positions. Those would likely pay in the 120K-140K CAD range from what I understand, eBay would be at 105k.

The next step for these interviews would be the technicals, which I do not feel confident for at all (Python, SQL LeetCode Mediums + statistics and ML design questions). I haven't studied for this stuff that much, and would really be cramming.

I have told eBay that I can let them know on Monday if the compensation is okay, I am tempted to go back to them and beg for $110K CAD, which would be a 15% bump, and mention that I am interested in the role, but the pay is just not working for me, especially that I am interviewing for two other positions that may pay better. So I want to request if I can continue the interview process with the other two, and get back to eBay with a final confirmation. Not sure how to phrase this, or if I should even show my hand like that.  
eBay HR was really nice, really felt like they were gunning for me, and the offer felt like the max they could squeeze out between Payroll and the Hiring team.

I'm just confused. In light of all of this, where can/should I go?

I was 65% in favour to take, 35% to reject, but given my friends/family advice that the pay is low and not worth moving, I am unsure.

I'm also not sure how to buy myself time for the interveiws with RH and Intuit, and god if I can even do them.

Is it really that bad to move for 10% base bump? Ignoring sign-on bonus, equity, quality of life?

Lastly, I'm not sure if eBay is a boost to my career or a step down; is it a good place to work? Is it frowned upon by other companies as a ""legacy tech company"" or something?

The Two Step SCM: A Tool for Data Scientists,1ce0ezw,"To data scientists who work in Python and causal inference, you may find the two-step synthetic control method helpful. It is a method developed by Kathy Li of Texas McCombs. I have written it from her MATLAB code, translating it into Python so more people can use it.

The method tests the validity of different parallel trends assumptions implied by different SCMs (the intercept, summation of weights, or both). It uses subsampling (or bootstrapping) to test these different assumptions. Based off the results of the null hypothesis test (that is, the validity of the convex hull) implements the recommended SCM model.

The page and [code](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth/blob/main/TSSC/TSSCVignette.md) is still under development (I still need to program the confidence intervals). However, it is generally ready for you to work with, should you wish. Please, if you have thoughts or suggestions, comment here or email me.

Would really love opinions. ,1c45zjn,"So I’m a hs math teacher. Over the past 4-5 years my school has started teaching data science. I’ve been teaching that for about 3-4 years. Very basic stuff at the HS level, basically intro to R and some stats.  

I’ve started to think about studying DS as a possible career path (and/or as a source of side income if that’s possible). 

I was looking around and saw that Berkeley extension offers a Bootcamp in data science. It’s not cheap and seems like it will take up a lot of my free time. 
But I’m having second thoughts about doing this.

Should I take the new offer?,1cequga,"I need help deciding if I should take a new job offer. I’m a recent grad and have 6 months of experience in my current role as a systems analyst at an academic research hospital. I mainly write SQL procedures, conduct ad-hoc data requests/data changes, do some light reporting, and write internal documentation. My salary is in the low 70s and I work fully remotely (don’t live with parents). I really love the team I work with, the work is fairly easy and stress-free, and the work-life balance is amazing.

I recently received an offer at a large health insurance company as a data analyst in a new grad rotational program. This offer is hybrid (2 days remote 3 days in-office) and pays in the high 70s + a variable yearly bonus. The office is 1 mile from where I live and I could walk or take 1 bus ride. There's a promotion and chance of full remote work depending on the team I join when the 1-year rotational program ends. This role aligns more with my career goals of becoming a data scientist and seems like I’d have more opportunities for career growth in the long run.

I’m having a hard time deciding whether to take this new role. The team I work with feels like a family and I don’t want to make the mistake of thinking the grass is greener on the other side when it feels like I have it pretty good in my first role out of college. The work in my current role also feels a bit more “meaningful” compared to big health insurance. However, I don’t really feel challenged right now.

On the other hand, I think the new role would open more doors for me in the future with a name brand on my resume, more analytics skills, and working with a more diverse tech stack. I’ll also be able to network and learn from more data scientists and analysts. I don’t do any analytics in my current role, but my manager supports my career goals. I'm just not sure when that time will come.

In my experience, my company does a lot of work on LLMs and I can say with absolute certainty that those projects are permutations and combinations of making an intelligent chatbot which can chat with your proprietary documents, summarize information, build dashboards and so on. I've prototyped these RAG systems (nothing in production, thankfully) and am not enjoying building them. I also don't like the LLM framework wars (Langchain vs Llamaindex vs this and that - although, Langchain sucks in my opinion).

What are the pressing research questions? What are the topics that I can explore in my personal (or company) time beyond RAG systems?

Finally, can anyone explain what the heck is agentic AI? Is it just a fancy buzzword for this sentence from Russell and Norvig's magnum opus AI book- "" A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome"".

What would you call a model that by nature is a feedback loop?,1cgvuy3,"So, I'm hoping someone could help me find some reading on a situation I'm dealing with. Even if that's just by providing a name for what the system is called it would be very helpful. My colleagues and I have identified a general concept at work but we're having a hard time figuring out what it's called so that we can research the implications.

tl;dr - what is this called?

1. Daily updated model with a static variable in it creates predictions of rent 
2. Predictions of rent are disseminated to managers in field to target as goal
3. When units are rented the rate is fed back into the system and used as an outcome variable
4. During this time a static predictor variable is in the model and it because it continuously contributes to the predictions, it becomes a proxy for the outcome variable

&#x200B;

I'm working on a model of rents for my employer. I've been calling the model incestuous as what happens is the model creates predictions for rents, those predictions are sent to the field where managers attempt to get said rents for a given unit. When a unit is filled the rent they captured goes back into the database where it becomes the outcome variable for the model that predicted the target rent in the first place. I'm not sure how closely the managers adhere to the predictions but my understanding is it's definitely something they take seriously.

If that situation is not sticky enough, in the model I'm updating the single family residence variables are from 2022 and have been in the model since then. The reason being, extracting it like trying to take out a bad tooth in the 1860s. When we try to replace it with more recent data it hammers goodness of fit metrics. Enough so that my boss questions why we would update it if we're only getting accuracy that's about as good as before. So I decided just to try every combination of every year of zillow data 2020 forward. Basically just throw everything at the wall and surely out of 44 combinations something will be better. That stupid 2022 variable and its cousin 21-22 growth were at the top as measured by R-Squared and AIC.

So a few days ago my colleagues and I had an idea. This variable has informed every price prediction for the past two years. Since it was introduced it has been creating our rent variable. And that's what we're predicting. The reason why it's so good at predicting is that *it is a proxy for the outcome variable*. So I split the data up by moveins in 22, 23, 24 (rent doesn't move much for in place tenants in our communities) and checked the correlation between the home values 22 variable and rent in each of those subsets. If it's a proxy for quality of neighborhoods, wealth, etc then it should be strongest in 22 and then decrease from there. Of course... it did the exact opposite.

So at this point I'm convinced this variable is, mildly put, quite wonky. I think we have to rip the bandaid off even if the model is technically worse off and instead have this thing draw from a SQL table that's updated as new data is released. Based on how much that correlation was increasing from 22 to 24, eventually this variable will become so powerful it's going to join Skynet and target us with our own weapons. But the only way to ensure buy in from my boss is to make myself a mini-expert on what's going on so I can make the strongest case possible. And unfortunately I don't even know what to call this system we believe we've identified. So I can't do my homework here. 

We've alternately been calling it self-referential, recursive, feedback loop, etc. but none of those are yielding information. If any of the wise minds here have any information or thoughts on this issue it would be greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cgvuy3/what_would_you_call_a_model_that_by_nature_is_a/,Tamalelulu,16,Statistics,15,Top - month

How to transition to machine learning engineering?,1cht1xs,"Im currently at a small tech consulting company. I have a master’s in data science but not much hard engineering experience.

 I’ve built 1 production system but it was still ‘low tech’. I was using excel files and then an AutoML tool and running time series forecasting offline at a regular cadence. But that project is done and it looks like clients I work with are all low tech and having to deploy anything with them seems like a pain. I work on POCs for ML modeling nowadays

I want to transition to a company where I can be on a better path and eventually try to be a software engineer in ML or an MLE. Finding opportunities to advance my skills are hard. I am currently interviewing at a company but the role seems more client focused and POC focused with maybe some opportunities to deploy / monitor ML systems. I am a little nervous that switching into a role that is not advertised as engineering heavy could be the wrong move

However, any company that works at large scale is probably better than what I do now. Any proper tech company where I can use proper tools like pyspark, databricks, etc seem like would put me in the path to do more engineering or ML at scale. 

I am curious what people think. What is the best way to break into MLE if you dont have large scale software experience and if your current best new role opportunities are not exactly engineering heavy but could have chances to build internal tools and deploy things sometimes? 

Personally I think I’ll try to do as much engineering work as possible in any new tech company that operates at sufficient scale. And maybe even gunning for an internal transfer to SWE / MLE if that ever shows up could be a move (and this has a chance of happening at new company not current one). And I’ll build some ML apps for personal projects as well. It seems like staying at a small consulting company will continue to hurt my long term skillsets since I don’t have exposure to proper tools and large scaled problems

FNN to predict improper vouchers. ,1c35bvi,"I am an auditor for a state agency, we audit payments the state makes every day to find improper voucher. 

We get about 30,000 vouchers a day so obviously we can’t audit all of them. So we set up certain risks associated with vouchers to try and better find improper payments. And sometime we have filters for payments that meet certain criteria that must get audited. 

However, our risk based design doesn’t really work, it’s just a chance of whether or not the vouchers selected for audited are improper or not. I don’t believe we have any better outcome that just randomly selecting a voucher everyday. 

It just depends on the risks the auditors look for and how well they look at it. However, I am trying to create a statistical model to find these improper vouchers based on these risks. 

As opposed to what some auditor thinks is the best risk, the model can look at all these risks and see how they interact and if there is some pattern. 

Additionally, a lot of these risks have some arbitrary cut off date. For example, we might have a risk saying the specific vendor hasn’t been audited in over a year. That’s considered risky, however, a voucher that misses that by one year wouldn’t be rated as risky. 

So doing this we can turn some categorical variables into continuous variables. 

The data set as of now is about 600,000 vouchers that have been audited over a ten year span. Currently about 8% of them have been rejected. But not all of the rejected ones were necessarily bad. We have two classes non compliance and saving. Savings are when the money is not due or at least some of it, bad math on the invoice, incorrect charges and so one. While non compliance don’t really save any money it’s just some account error, maybe they paid from the wrong funds, referenced the wrong contract or something. It’s gonna mess up the accounting system but not really save any money. About 20% of rejected vouchers have saving and 80% are non compliant. 

Obviously our goal is to identify vouchers that yield a saving. Even if we had a model that can predict all the improper ones, we just don’t have the resource to audit all of them. 

So my thoughts were to create a model fine tuned to have low false positive. Basically I would have a penalizing model for instances of an okay voucher being marked as improper. 

Obviously we’d miss some improper vouchers from that but we also don’t have the resource to audit them all anyway so my thought is this would allow us to focus on those that might be improper. 

Just wondering if you guys have. Any thoughts on this. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c35bvi/fnn_to_predict_improper_vouchers/,CaptainVJ,13,Discussion,19,Top - month
different splits yield a very different result,1c9eiuj,"Hello all,

i have a problem where i have to predict a class for each line in a pdf , my data set consists of lines from different pdf files, when i shuffle the dataset and split with random lines in train, test sets i got a high score >0.96 , but when i group the dataset by document, and take some document for training and others for testing and i get a very poor score <0.9  
what do you think could be the problem, and which splitting method is correct ?

update : 

my application is a model that first get a pdf as input, then the pipeline parses it into a separate lines, then we are extracting different features for each line (styling features, position features, .... ) then for each line labels is either a normal line or it is a section beginning, and for section beginnings label is a number that specify the nesting level of this section.

"Sampling from a large, not independent dataset  ",1c8jbrm,"So I’m building a simple regression model to predict fuel consumption for trucks in a large food company. We have data from different trips  from different routes. 

Some routes have much more trips and are thus over represented in the data. Let’s say as an example that we have 10 routes, with 8 routes having 10 individual trips and 1 route having 1000 trips. If I would just randomly sample the data most of the data would come from the large route, reducing the regression problem to basically fitting that specific route. 

Now that isn’t something we want because we would like to take into account different geographic information from the various routes (a route has a number of geographic and specific features). Should I just perform stratified sampling? 

This brings me to our second problem, that the different trips won’t be independent. If I sample 10 trips from the large route then all the input variables unique for the route will all be the same, having only variability in trip specific features such as time of day or weight of the freight. How should we account for this? Using a hierarchical model maybe?

Predicting successful pharma drug launch,1c2tz99,"I have a dataset with monthly metrics tracking the launch of various pharmaceutical drugs.  There are several different drugs and treatment areas in the dataset, grouped by the lifecycle month.  For example:



|Drug|Treatment Area|Month|Drug Awareness (1-10)|Market Share (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|1|2|.05|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|2|3|.07|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|3|5|.12|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|...|...|...|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|18|6|.24|
|ABC|Psoriasis|1|1|.02|
|ABC|Psoriasis|2|3|.05|
|ABC|Psoriasis|3|4|.09|

|ABC|Psoriasis|18|5|.20|
|ABC|Dermatitis|1|7|.20|
|ABC|Dermatitis|2|7|.22|
|ABC|Dermatitis|3|8|.24|

* Drugs XYZ and ABC may have been launched years apart, but we are tracking the month relative to launch date.  E.g. month 1 is always the first month after launch.
* Drug XYZ might be prescribed for several treatment areas, so has different metric values for each treatment area (e.g. a drug might treat psoriasis & dermatitis)
* A metric like ""Drug awareness"" is the to-date cumulative average rating based on a survey of doctors.  There are several 10-point Likert scale metrics like this
* The target variable is ""Market Share (%)"" which is the % of eligible patients using the drug
* A full launch cycle is 18 months, so we have some drugs that have undergone the full 18-month cycle can that be used for training, and some drugs that are currently in launch that we are trying to predict success for.

Thus, a ""good"" launch is when a drug ultimately captures a significant portion of eligible market share.  While this is somewhat subjective what ""significant"" means, let's assume I want to set thresholds like 50% of market share eventually captured.

Questions:

1. Should I model a time-series and try to predict the future market share?
2. Or should I use classification to predict the chance the drug will eventually reach a certain market share (e.g. 50%)?

My problem with classification is the difficulty in incorporating the evolution of the metrics over time, so  I feel like time-series is perfect for this.

However, my problem with time-series is that we aren't looking at a single entity's trend--it's a trend of several different drugs launched at different times that may have been successful or not.  Maybe I can filter to only successful launches and train off that time-series trend, but I would probably significantly reduce my sample size.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

Am I really a Data Analyst?,1clqh1h,"Hello everyone. It is my first post here, but I read this subreddit nearly each day as a way to understand more about this world. So, first of all, nice to contact you, dudes.

My question refers to the exact nature of the rol I am currently playing in a company. So, let me explain (TL;DR at the end of the post, here just the long explanation):

* **My background**: I'm a Psychology Bachelor, with two Ms. in Criminology and a third one in Methodology and Statistics. Contrary to the majority in my country (studying criminology in Spain is interesting, but it's horrible to find a job with that), I was able to enrole with a Computer Science research team from a very famous university in Spain, where I started analyzing online profiles to participate in research (both from a NLP and a bit of SNA perspective). As I was very very interested on Data Analysis and statistics (I'm not a very good statician, but at least I am really interested on it and happy to learn and study new things), they convinced me to do a PhD in Computer Science (which was focused on that topic, classic NLP and SNA to study social data online). With a lot of effort, I finished it and continued working on Academia till a year ago, when I was so burned out of several things of Spanish academia that I decided to start looking for new jobs. My environment always told me that my profile was quite interesting, but I had lot of problems trying to get interviews, as my profile is, as we say in Spain, ""an apprendice of everything, but master of none"" (I think that, in English, is "" Jack of *all trades*, *master of none* "". But, after a few months, I found a company focused on social data analysis projects that interviewed me and gave me an offer.
* **The original interview + offer**: they interviewed me for a Data Analyst position (nor junior, nor senior). The interview was a first one with HR, asking about my general CV, and then with a team manager and a ""senior"" data analyst. The interview was waaaaaaay too easy. They shared their screen and showed me a dataset on Excel, and asked me very simple things about it (e.g. what can you tell me about this pattern, what would you do to extract information from this couple of variables, how would you deal with missing data, etc). For me, it was a relief, as I've been working a lot at academia and wanted to have something easier to do, at least for some time. I guess they were interested on me, as they decided to gave me an offer (data analyst, 32K€, better salary than in academia, and FULL remote work, which was ideal for me since I prefered to go back from Madrid to a little city in the coast of Spain, with family and friends). I accepted without any doubts, and left academia.
* **The problem: I've been working three months for that company. In the beginning, I thought I would work as ""simple"" dat**a analyst on Excel (in, let's say, more or less ""structured"" projects). However, they told me that, due to my profile, they preferred me to be involved in ""innovation"" projects, which sounded interesting. On those projects, I'm working with a single manager, which is in contact with the client and tells me what type of analysis he wants on the pipeline, which I build in Python, translating every idea he tells me into ""regular"" analysis. For the built of that pipeline, I need knowledge on Python (they did not ask me to test my skills on Python during the interview), SQL (same), NLP (same), SNA (same), a little bit of PowerBI (same) and a little bit of Excel (this was the only thing covered). Also, each time I tell the manager that an analysis is too complicated and there is another way to deal with the idea he has, he always discards my idea and tells me to do it they way he wants. Most of the times, this means a lot of hours wasted, and no apologies. Also, another manager told me that he wanted me to ""guide"" the rest of the data analysts of the company, which are more junior than me, and structure a whole ""data analysis"" department. I thought that meant that I would work as a... lead data analyst? But they told me that was just dealing with internal projects with all the data analysts to improve general analysis for future projects. I said that was OK for me (I know is naive, but is my first data analyst job outside academia and, to be honest, I'm interested on leading a team). However, usually data analysts are required to be involved on company projects 110% of the time (most of the time doing extra hours), and this means that, each time I distribute work among us and we meet in 4-5 days, no one was able to advance on it due to other duties of the company (each manager wants their work to be absolute priority). Also, interestingly, the other data analysts do usually work with Excel and PowerBI, using Python just in rare occassions.

TL;DR: Bachelor in Psychology, 2 Ms. in Criminology, 1 Ms. in Statistics, PhD in Computer Science, low-medium knowledge in Python (most of the time using chatGPT and adapting the code), low knowledge SQL, regular skills with Excel and PowerBI, good knowledge of statistics. In the company, they want me to be ""lead"" without saying I am the ""lead"" data analyst (kind of...informal?), with no clear duties regarding that ""lead"" beyond organizing small projects with the other data analysts to improve the general performance of company projects, and usually dealing with programming, NLP and SNA to adapt the ideas of a manager to ""actual"" analysis into a pipeline.

**So, the question is... am I really a Data Analyst?**

Less Weighting to assign to outliers in  time series forecasting?,1c99xba,"Hi data scientists here, 

I've tried to ask my colleagues at work but seems I didn't find the right group of people. We use time series forecasting , specifically Facebook Prophet , to forecast revenue. The revenue is similar to data packages with a telecom provided to customers. With certain subscriptions we have seen huge spike because of hacked accounts hence outliers, and they are 99% one time phenomenon. Another kind of outliers come from users who ramp their usage occasionally 

Does FB Prophet have a mechanism to assign very little weight to outliers? I thought there's some theory in probablities which says the probability of a certain random variable  being further away from a specific number converges to zero. (Weak law of large number) . So can't we assign a very little weight to those dots that are very far from the mean (i.e. large variance) or below a certain probability ?

Advice on what types of entry-level roles to seek,1c1yc8i,"Hello! 

I'm looking for some career advice on what types of roles to seek, resume help, and how to get feedback on an NLP Developer technical project that I completed. 

A little about me: I have a B.Sc. in CS, a data science internship (data visualization, data analysis, and LLM experience), and research experience (published in JMIR). I've been looking for work, full-time, for about a month and a half now, 170 applications sent, and minimal responses so far. **My end goal is to find a DS/ML role**. Something that will allow me to learn more technical skills in ML. I am primarily seeking remote roles in Canada and the United States, but am open to hybrid in my location. At some point, I plan on going back to school to receive an master's in CS specializing in ML, but at the moment, I'm looking to get more work experience.

The only response I've received so far is from an international company as NLP developer. I wrote a technical project for them, but sadly did not receive the role or any feedback on my submission. I have posted two examples of resumes that I might submit. I tailor my resume for each job, which usually means using an ATS checker and changing the summary/skills section to match the verbiage of the job. I'm looking for some advice:

**1)** At the moment, I'm casting a wide net in terms of roles. I've been applying to entry-level DA/DS/DE and ML related roles. Recently, I've focused a bit more on the DA roles, as I generally have all the skills they are asking for, and my data science internship involved a lot of dashboard building. That said, I am most interested in roles that involve ML (especially LLM and NLP).

I sometimes feel as though I'm selling myself short by applying so much to data analytics roles when I really want ML. **Should I continue to cast a wide net in terms of roles, or would it be better to focus more time on applying to only DS/ML roles?**

I should mention, time is of the essence, and work experience is so valuable in this market, so I would rather start working as a data analyst now than hold out for another year to find an ML role.

**2)** Related to Q1. I'm currently working on the Google Data Analytics Profesional cert, which I'm finding boring and easy. At this point, I will finish it, but I'm wondering what certs to take next. I could do more data analytics certs, but I was considering doing Andrew Ng's ML and DL certs on Coursea. **Would you recommend these certs, or any comments on other certs to take?**

**3)** **Do you have any suggestions on my resumes?** I know that it's a bit verbose in the skills section, but I'm trying to ensure that I make it through the initial screening if they are using AI.

**4)** **Where can I post my technical project for the NLP developer position that I applied to?** I would love to get some feedback on my submission, and I think it could be helpful for other Redditors looking for the same types of roles.

- several meetups in NY as it seems to be the place with the most vacancies,  
- I want to go to workspots/techhubs/incubators to network and I also have to do some work. Any recommendations for places that actually stimulate networking (not WeWork and the likes) are highly appreciated!  
- I actually got the advice to go to a gym where a lot of rich tech people go called equinox. Not sure how serious I should take that. But I like weird stuff like that as it might also lead to some surprise connections.

So have received a take home exercise for a job interview that I am currently in the final stages of, and would really like to nail. The task is fairly simple and having eyeballed it I already know what I intend to do. However the task has provided me with a number of csv files to use in my analysis and subsequent presentation. However they have mentioned that I would be judged on my sql code. Granted I could probably do this faster in excel i.e. vlookups to simulate the joins I need to make to create the 'end table' etc however it seems like I will need to use the sql and will be getting partially judged on the cleanliness and integrity of my code. This too is not a problem and in my mind I already know what I would like to do. However all my experience is working in IDE's that my work has paid for. To complete this exercise I would need to load these csv files into a open source SQL IDE of some sort (or at least so I think). However I have no idea whats out there and what I should use. also I would ideally like to present this notebook style and sop suggestions where I could run commentary and code side by side a la colab that may be fit for purpose would be greatly appreciated.

Help Deciding Between Two Graduate Schools,1bzjlkf,"Hey all, I have until this April 15th to decide between two graduate schools and I can't figure out which is best for a career in data science. I'd love to get some advice from some professional data scientists. The following are the two schools and programs:

1. **Texas A&M's MSCS program**. 2 years long for a total cost of attendance  \~60k.
2. **North Carolina State's MS in Advanced Analytics program**. 10 months long for a total cost of attendance  \~64k.

Here are what i deem the pros and cons of each program:

||Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Texas A&M's MSCS|**Likely would get a research assistantship** as I am both a domestic student and have research experience. I estimate this would lower my total cost to \~30k.|The **career path after graduation is not as clear**. Also I do not want to live in Texas upon graduation.|
|North Carolina State's MSA|The MSA program is very well respected and all graduates are guaranteed a job. Last years class had a **median salary of $117,000** upon graduation (jobs typically are in NC. Huge alumni network consisting of data science professionals.|I will be taking out **$64,000 in loans** for 10 months of schooling.|

Classification - using both euclidean distance and cosine similarity for inference,1chmmf3,"Context
- existing label split into 3 sub labels
- labeled historical data for existing label exists, but none for the 3 new sub labels
- idea is to use sub label description to get labeled data for the 3 sub labels
- but won't be able to get a lot of labeled data (because taggers actual role isn't to do tagging)

Given a query document, inference can be done
- option 1: using binary classifier for each sub label
- option 2: use label of the document nearest to the query document to predict label of query document
- option 3: use similarity between sub label description and query document to predict label of query document
- option 4: combination of options 2 and 3

Option 1 may not be ideal as the amount of labeled data for sub labels will likely not yield performant binary classifiers. If they don't fulfil the metrics set by stakeholders, they shouldn't be deployed which is where options 2, 3 and 4 came about. 

Option 2 is one shot classification using euclidean distance. It's opportunistic because it'll predict the sub labels if taggers had labeled the nearest document with the sub labels. 

Option 3 is zero shot classification using cosine similarity, because it doesn't rely on any historical documents to make prediction.

Option 4 mitigates the opportunistic factor of option 2 by allowing another similarity measure (option 3) to influence the prediction of the query document. This is the option I'm leaning towards should option 1 not meet stakeholders' expectations. 

Wanted to ask this is a sound approach to handling classification of documents with new labels? Or if you have tackled such problem in a different way, feel free to suggest!

Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (REALM),1c29ri7,"I just came upon (what I think is) the original REALM paper, [“Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909). Really interesting idea, but there are some key details that escaped me regarding the role of the retriever. I was hoping someone here could set me straight:

1. **First and most critically, is retrieval-augmentation only relevant for generative models?** You hear a lot about RAG, but couldn’t there also be like RAU? Like in encoding some piece of text X for a downstream non-generative task Y, the encoder has access to a knowledge store from which relevant information is identified, retrieved, and then included in the embedding process to refine the model’s representation of the original text X? Conceptually this makes sense to me, and it seems to be what the REALM paper did (where the task Y was QA), but I can’t find any other examples online of this kind of thing. Retrieval-augmentation only ever seems to be applied to generative tasks. So yeah, is that always the case, or can RAU also exist?

2. **If a language model is trained using retrieval augmentation, that would mean the retriever is part of the model architecture, right?** In other words, come inference time, there must always be some retrieval going on, which further implies that the knowledge store from which documents are retrieved must also always exist, right? Or is all the machinery around the retrieval piece only an artifact of training and can be dropped after learning is done?

3. **Is the primary benefit of REALM that it allows for smaller model?** The rationale behind this question: Without the retrieval step, the 100% of the model’s latent knowledge must be contained within the weights of the attention mechanism (I think). For foundation models which are expected to know basically everything, that requires a huge number of weights. However if the model can inject context into the representation via some other mechanism, such as retrieval augmentation, the rest of the model after retrieval (e.g., the attention mechanism) has less work to do and can be smaller/simpler.

Tough call: How important is choosing MSc Dissertation Topic in Data Science,1c18y1q," 

I'm 22-23 years old, currently at a crossroads in choosing my dissertation placement project for my MSc in Data Science and could really use your collective wisdom. One offers **stipend (3000 pounds**) (which I really want to take), others don't. Stipend provider project is about healthcare analytics with geospatial data (idk kind of not good career potential) and there is strong supervision, it will solve real life problem and might lead to **publications**. And then there is **offer from Bank of England** which offers no stipend, no supervision, not sufficient literature review (more work should be done on modelling) but aligns with my Economics bachelors, and would look good on CV. Since I want to do phd, I also have option of doing **internal dissertation project** which I can do on my interest field which is **Machine Learning** ( Developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from data)

Main: One of the options I'm considering is a project focused on ""Visualizing Geospatial Trachoma Diagnostic Data and Risk Factors."" This involves providing analytic and mapping support to a multi-country study on trachoma in countries like Zambia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Cameroon, and Nigeria.

Here's what I'd love to get your thoughts on:

1. How easy is it to transition between sectors (e.g., from healthcare to finance, tech, etc.) in data science? Does specializing early help or hinder long-term career flexibility?
2. Are the skills and experiences from a healthcare-focused project like this seen as valuable in other sectors within data science?
3. Have any of you made a sector switch in your data science career? What challenges did you face, and what advice would you have for someone early in their career?
4. For those of you who have worked on healthcare data or similar projects, what has been your experience?

Three Practical Use Cases of Machine Learning and Digital Twins in Clinical Research and Care,1bz20r9,"Hi all, thought my most recent Substack post would be of interest to those working in the healthcare/life sciences space. I talk about how we can use big data and machine learning to bring more personalized care through what’s called “digital twins.” Essentially, it uses historical data to look at the outcomes of people who share similar characteristics to you. Using Alzheimer’s Disease as a motivating example, there’s three use-cases for digital twins I discuss in my post:

1. Reducing the size of randomized trial control arms through the prediction of treatment arm outcomes via their digital twins. The company with the most work on this space that I know of is [Unlearn.ai](https://www.unlearn.ai/). This would ideally save recruitment time and costs that scale per patient and per site.
2. Using digital twins to calculate a prognostic score of disease progression and, in a trial, recruiting only those who are more likely to rapidly progress. In the literature, this is often called “enrichment.” When people progress at a faster rate, we can run the trial for less time while still having a good chance to observe a treatment effect if it’s there. 
3. Using digital twins to help inform the delivery of precision medicine in routine care (e.g. at the doctor’s office). Crucially, this system should be tested in randomized trials versus standard of care.

If any of these topics interest you, [check out the post here](https://open.substack.com/pub/mlinhealthcare/p/leveraging-machine-learning-using?r=7bxky&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)!

Discussion: AI for data science,1casob4,"**Do you think that AI can help data science teams beyond just ""ask data / text2sql"" chatbots?**

I've been in DS for a while, both as an IC and now as a lead. Despite improvements in analytics tools and workflows, getting to meaningful insights is still a very labor intensive and code heavy process. It especially takes a significant time to perform exploratory/foundational analysis, which can limit the ability to tackle more specialized problems and also increases the risk of overlooking something entirely.

I've been building something to address this, here's the elevator pitch: **an autonomous AI data scientist that proactively explores data, discovers insights, and presents findings in plain English**. This will give data teams an advantage by discovering core insights faster and pinpointing precisely where to initiate more in-depth analysis.

I have an MVP that can do what I am promising - users can connect/upload data and the product will iteratively plan, perform analysis, and interpret the results, each time summarizing findings into key themes. Under the hood, I'm using LLMs to orchestrate analysis and interpret results but using robust data science pipelines to perform the actual analysis. Accuracy and reliability is at the core.

I'm curious about the community's thoughts on this problem and my approach for a solution. Am I onto something or do I have it wrong?

* How much time do you/your teams spend on foundational analysis compared to deeper problem-solving or modeling?
* Is time often a limiting factor to how much you can explore before committing to a certain analysis path?
* Assuming you could trust its output, do you think ""proactive"" AI driven insights would be valuable?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1casob4/discussion_ai_for_data_science/,SwimmingMeringue9415,6,Discussion,25,Top - month
Using Cloud Compute and Parallelization,1c5jwqv," 

I’m running transformer models from Hugging Face on my laptop with python/jupyter notebooks. These notebooks take hours to run and I’d like to learn how to accelerate them. I believe my next steps are working with a cloud computing service to offload my code onto stronger computers, as well as editing my code to make use of parallelization.

Does anyone have recommendations on services and/or resources for how to get started? I’m probably going to start looking into some sort of aws service (sagemaker?) and my friend mentioned dask to me, so I’ll look into that as well.

Right now my code is calling these models using the standard pipeline method within a list comprehension. I believe I’ll need to change that, as I’m expecting that to not be parallelizable. Any advice? I’ve got a data frame with many rows and I’m trying to run a model on text within these rows for things like sentiment analysis and zero shot classification.

"Real-time hypothesis testing, premature stopping ",1c4uvfr,"Say I want to start offering a discount for shopping in my store. I want to run a test to see if it's a cost-effective idea. I demand an improvement of $d in average sale $s to compensate for the cost of the discount. I start offering the discount randomly to every second customer. Given the average traffic in my store, I determine I should be running the experiment for at least 4 months to determine the true effect equal to d at alpha 0.05 with 0.8 power. 


1. Should my hypothesis be: 

H0: s_exp - s_ctrl < d

And then if I reject it means there's evidence the discount is cost effective (and so I start offering the discount to everyone) 

Or 

H0: s_exp - s_ctrl > d 

And then if I don't reject it means there's *no* evidence the discount is *not* cost effective (and so i keep offering the discount to everyone or at least to half of the clients to keep the test going)


2. What should I do if after four months, my test is not conclusive? All in all, I don't want to miss the opportunity to increase the profit margin, even if true effect is 1.01*d, right above the cost-effectiveness threshold. As opposed to pharmacology, there's no point in being too conservative in making business right? Can I keep running the test and avoid p-hacking?


3. I keep monitoring the average sales daily, to make sure the test is running well. When can I stop the experiment before preassumed amount of sample is collected, because the experimental group is performing very well or very bad and it seems I surely have enough evidence to decide now? How to avoid p-hacking with such early stopping?


Bonus 1: say I know a lot about my clients: salary, height, personality. How to keep refining what discount to offer based on individual characteristics? Maybe men taller than 2 meters should optimally receive two times higher discount for some unknown reasons?


Bonus 2: would bayesian hypothesis testing be better-suited in this setting? Why?

Bootstrap Procedure for Max,1cmjlvx,"Hello my fellow DS/stats peeps,

I am working on a new problem where I am dealing with 15 years worth of hourly data of average website clicks. On a given day, I am interested in estimating the peak volume of clicks on a website with a 95% confidence interval. The way I am going about this is by bootstrapping my data 10,000 times for each day but I am not sure if I am doing this right or it might not even be possible.

Procedure looks as follows:

* Group all Jan 1, Jan 2,… Dec 31 into daily buckets. So I have 15 years worth of hourly data for each of these days, or 360 data points (15\*24).
* For a single day bucket (take Jan 1), I sample 24 values (to mimic the 24 hour day) from the 1/1 bucket to create a resampled day, store the max during each resampling. I do this process 10,000 times for each day.
   * At this point, I have 10,000 bootstrapped maxes for all days of the year.

This is where I get a little lost. If I take the .975 and .025 of the 10,000 bootstrapped maxes for each day, in theory these should be my 95% bands of where the max should live. When I bootstrap my max point estimate by taking the max of the 10,000 samples, it’s the same as my upper confidence band.

Am I missing something theoretical or maybe my procedure is off? I’ve never bootstrapped a max or maybe it is not something that is even recommended/possible to do.

A Tale of Two Cultures: Integrating Data Science and MLOps to Build Successful ML Products,1c0rhdm," When the excitement about data science became widespread about 10 years ago, this spurred a lot of proof-of-concept ideas. However, most of these stayed confined in Jupyter notebooks and never made it into production. There are multiple reasons why it has been a lot harder than initially expected to productionize ML models, but the one I want to focus on in this blog post is one that has not been explored in as much depth. In order to create business value, we have to marry two very different approaches: The ML lifecycle starts out on the exploratory data science side, but we eventually have to transition towards an engineering-driven approach in order to achieve the quality attributes such as availability, reliability, scalability, and security typically expected of production systems. Thus, what it takes to do good work in data science is fundamentally opposed to what it takes to do good work in MLOps, giving rise to different best practices, skill sets, and even mentalities (ways of thinking about problems) on each side. As a result, a central challenge for creating successful ML products is to find a good process for making these two different cultures work well together. 

This is very detailed article by  *Thomas Loeber, Senior Machine Learning Engineer at*  Logic20/20, Inc.

[NLP] Detect news headlines at the intersection of Culture & Technology,1cfvts1,"Hi nerds!

I’m a web dev with 10YoE and for the first time I’m working on a NLP project from scratch so… I’m in need of some wisdom.

Here's my goal : **detect news headlines at the intersection of Culture and Technology**.   

For example:
- VR usage in museums
- AI art (in music, movies, litterature etc)
- digital creativity
- cultural heritage & tech
- VC funding in the creativity space
- … you get the idea.

I've built Django app, scraping a ton of data from hundreds of RSS feeds in this space, but it’s not labeled or anything and there’s a lot of irrelevant noise. The intersection of Culture and Technology is rare, and also blurry because the concept of ""Culture"" is hard to catch.

I figured I need to create a ML classifier for news headlines, so as a first step I have manually labeled ~300 news headlines as revelant - to use as training data.

Now I'm experimenting with scikit-learn to build the classifier but I have really no idea what I'm doing.

My questions are:
1. Do you think my approach makes sense (manually labeling + training a ML classifier on top)
2. Do you have any recommendation regarding the type of classifier and the tools to build it ?
3. Do you know any dataset that could help me      
4. Do you have any advice in general for a rookie like me

Seeking feedback on project scoping,1cfnvnx,"Can I get your feedback on some scoping work?

My task is to assess the accuracy of a system that calculates payments for invoices. It's an open-ended request for rough-and-ready insights. I am thinking through the analytical approach while waiting for data.

The complex payment policies make it impractical to independently validate individual payments at scale, so I can't directly label the payments as correct or incorrect. Instead I plan to characterize payment distributions and work with SMEs to distinguish those that fall in plausible and implausible ranges. I imagine a linear regression that controls for known payment drivers (e.g., type and quantity of services), enabling me to interpret large residuals as anomalous payments.

After this initial pass, I would work with SMEs to hypothesize causes for implausible payments and extract features to capture those causes (e.g., a flag for invoices that later had to be corrected). Then I would try to use these features to cluster implausible cases or separate them from plausible ones. The goal would be an interpretable model that highlights common scenarios causing payment anomalies.

Asking for a promotion too soon?,1c3t6ww,"Hi all,

Some context for the situation,
I’m a career switcher (sales-> tech staffing AM -> self employed personal trainer -> Data Scientist )

I will be graduating with my MS-DS next month (May) and have been working full time as a DS since October 23. (With a 3 month internship at the same company prior to coming on full time).

I was brought in as entry level (BS and no prior experience required)

I was pulled into a project that ended up being multifaceted and find that I am collaborating with a principal on how to tackle the problems we face, solutions we build, and deadlines for each piece etc. We divide the work pretty evenly and are responsible for our respective deliverables.

Our lead suggests that I need to make the case now for a promotion given what we’ve done thus far in terms of work load, deliverables etc 
And while I “feel” like that makes sense my brain says “I’ve only been here 6 mths”.

When is it too soon? I was planning on letting the project wrap up and presenting my progress, and value add to the company along with including that I am now an MS grad but wanted to see what the more experienced folks have to share

Imputation methods satisfying constraints,1c7xt1z,"Hey everyone,

I have here a dataset of KPI metrics from various social media posts. For those of you lucky enough to not be working in digital marketing, the metrics in question are things like:

* ""impressions"" (number of times a post has been seen)
* ""reach"" (number of unique accounts who have seen a post) 
* ""clicks"", ""comments"", ""likes"", ""shares"", etc (self-explanatory)

The dataset in question is incomplete, the missing values are distributed across pretty much every dimension, and my job is to develop a model to fill in those missing values. So far I've tested a KNN imputer with some success, as well as an Iterative imputer (MICE) with much better results. 

But there's 1 problem that persists: some values need to be constrained by others in the same entry. Imagine for instance that a given post had 55 ""Impressions"", meaning that it has been seen 55 times, and we try to fill the missing ""Reach"" (number of unique accounts that have seen that post). Obviously that amount cannot be higher than 55. A post cannot be viewed 55 times by 60 different accounts. There are a bunch of such constraints that I somehow need to pass in to my model, I've tried looking into the MICE algorithm to find an answer there but without success. 

Does anyone know of a way I can enforce these types of constraints? Or is there another data imputation method that's better suited for this type of task?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c7xt1z/imputation_methods_satisfying_constraints/,Antoinefdu,2,Analysis,5,Top - month

Looking for a decision-making framework ,1c32kuk,"I'm a data analyst working for a loan lender/servicer startup. I'm the first statistician they hired for a loan servicing department and I think I might be reinventing a wheel here.

The most common problem at my work is asking ""we do X to make a borrower perform better. Should we be doing that?""

For example when a borrower stops paying, we deliver a letter to their property. I performed a randomized A/B test and checked if such action significantly lowers a probability of a default using a two-sample binomial test. I also used Bayesian hypothesis testing for some similar problems.

However, this problem gets more complicated. For example, say we have four different campaigns to prevent the default, happening at various stages of delinquency and we want to learn about the effectiveness of each of these four strategies. The effectiveness of the last (fourth) campaign could be underestimated, because the current effect is conditional on the previous three strategies not driving any payments.

Additionally, I think I'm asking a wrong question most of the time. I don't think it's essential to know if experimental group performs better than control at alpha=0.05. It's rather the opposite: we are 95% certain that a campaign is *not* cost-effective and should be retired? The rough prior here is ""doing something is very likely better than doing nothing ""

As another example, I tested gift cards in the past for some campaigns: ""if you take action A you will get a gift card for that."" I run A/B testing again. I assumed that in order to increase the cost-effectives of such gift card  campaign, it's essential to make this offer time-constrained, because the more time a client gets, the more likely they become to take a desired action spontaneously, independently from the gift card incentive. So we pay for something the clients would have done anyway. Is my thinking right? Should the campaign be introduced permanently only if the test shows that we are 95% certain that the experimental group is more cost-effective than the control? Or is it enough to be just 51% certain? In other words, isn't the classical frequentist 0.05 threshold too conservative for practical business decisions?


1. Am I even asking the right questions here?
2. Is there a widely used framework for such problem of testing sequential treatments and their cost-effectivess? How to randomize the groups, given that applying the next treatment depends on the previous treatment not being effective? Maybe I don't even need control groups, just a huge logistic regression model to eliminate the impact of the covariates?
3. Should I be 95% certain we are doing good or 95% certain we are doing bad (smells frequentist) or just 51% certain (smells bayesian) to take an action?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c32kuk/looking_for_a_decisionmaking_framework/,Ciasteczi,2,Statistics,16,Top - month

Career roadmap and advice please. Transitioning from Academia to DS.,1c1v5vc,"Hello!

I'm 46, Masters in Operations Research,  BS in Pure and Applied Math. I have been focusing on an academic career for a while, but lost my full-time professorship because I had problems with grading and meeting deadlines (I suffer from clinical depression). I am currently an adjunct math professor and cannot pay my bills. I love Applied Mathematics:, MDP, Game Theory, Simulation and I want to transition into some kind of Data Science field where I can learn more and utilize knowledge I have from grad school and more. I am not particularly interested in Finance or Medicine, and would find it much more interesting to work for physicists, chemists, biologists, economists, or other scientists. I am also very concerned about being able to acquire a career of this sort (and keeping it considering my depression). 

My current plan is to finish 4 Coursera specializations: Python, Data Science, Data Science with R, Intermediate Data Science; 3 textbooks: Probability and Statistics for Engineers (mostly a review, but my education heavily learns toward Modeling and Probability Theory rather than Statistics), Linear Models with R, and Acing the Data Science Interview. After doing a few projects and developing a portfolio, I hope that I can find an entry level position. Then, over the next 2-3 years I would like to study Machine Learning and finding the intersection with that and my OR background --Hopefully such a field exists. At this time I may get a second masters or maybe finish my PhD. Finally, I would hope to have a career when I turn 50.

I understand my depression is a big problem, but I am not going to just go on welfare and eek out an existence for the rest of my life. If you will, please look past this issue for the moment.

My current questions are: 
1) What is your opinion of my plan? Is it viable? What roadblocks might I encounter?
2) What job titles should I apply for as an entry-level data scientist? Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, MLOps, MLE.... I really don't know where I would fit.
3) Although I want to work for scientists, is this domain viable? Should I apply for my common domains like FAANG, Finance, or Medicine?
4) Ultimately, what job title should I be aiming for considering my interests.

Lastly, any other advice would be greatly appreciated!

How much does the topic of a MS Stat thesis matter when hiring? ,1c7mn25,"I’m going to be starting my Masters Thesis in my stats program. I have narrowed down two projects with different faculty members. One of them is entirely self guided, and that advisor doesn’t really have any expertise in this area and the other one is basically with another faculty member but the research topic is within his domain, so he can help me, but the application strays too far from what industry I want to be in.

Project 1:  Causal Machine Learning, and nonparametric estimation for identifying heterogenous treatment effects in advertising/marketing data. 

There’s a dataset by a company in the marketing/adtech space that they have made public, and is essentially an open dataset related to shopping transactions, and demographics of shoppers, and information on marketing campaigns that were run by the company. 

Ideally this would be a causal inference project, where I get to actually learn causal inference and causal (double) machine learning on my own, and apply it to this dataset. No new methods being created, just a standalone causal inference analysis and basically I walk away with learning a new area of statistics and a way to solve causal problems. 

My advisors background is nonparametric regression so he would be able to give me advice on the estimators being used (some of the methods use random forests, tree based methods, splines, kernel methods etc.) so he could be of help in that sense. But he knows nothing about causal inference. So I’d be on my own on this one.

I want to take on this project despite it being quite isolated because I want to signal to my future employer that I can work on data science problems involving causal inference.
 
I only have 1 year, so id have to self learn causal inference + do the analysis + the paper. 

Project 2: Bayesian Dimension Reduction in gene expression data

Another advisor works in the area of dimension reduction, and broadly works in genomics. The project he was proposing for me was an actual opportunity to create some new methods. So much more on the research side than doing an analysis like project 1. 

It involves looking at Bayesian approaches to doing common dimension reduction techniques like PCA, Factor Analysis etc.

From this paper I’d walk away with a good opporuntity to  dive deeper into Bayesian inference, and work on methods research. I’ve never done a bayes project before, despite just taking a class on it.

The cons to this is I don’t really have any interest working in bioinformatics, but this research is within the realm of my advisor so he can actually help me. The other con, is I don’t want my future employer to think I’m not qualified for tasks involving causal inference because I worked on dimension reduction, and with applications to genetic data, which is not really the industry I want to be in. 


Does anyone have any input on this? Does choosing a topic not related to causal inference lessen my chances of getting a job involving that? Do people care what my thesis topic is? Or does the MS in Stats signal that I could work on causal inference?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c7mn25/how_much_does_the_topic_of_a_ms_stat_thesis/,Direct-Touch469,1,Discussion,18,Top - month
"What are some good approaches to detect mislabeling/misclassification while being resilient to outliers, anomalies, and new emergent classes?",1c6c2da,"I'm working on a self-driven project where I'm taking data, clustering it using DBSCAN or OPTICS, and passing the data and labels to a classifier to train. The overall goal is anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and behavioral analysis and my approach has been to remove conserved (repeated) patterns as ""knowns"", provide a best-fit for anomalies under the assumption that the sample belongs to a known class but contains a type of anomaly (or is an outlier), and to flag unknown cases as either more prominent anomalies or, in cases where anomalies bear a measure of self-similarity, a new, emergent class.

Currently, I am using an ensemble of OVR binary classifiers (SVMs), each trained on a single target class against all other samples, as a recognition network. I also have a boosted ensemble (random forest) trained similarly to provide consensus to the output of the recognition system.

I have a k-NN classifier that is trained only on clustered data (samples labeled as noise by clustering was removed from this training set) to act as a rectification system for mislabeling/misclassification.

So, if a sample is passed through and there's a consensus in the recognition network, it can bypass the rectification system. If consensus is not met, the rectification system attempts to identify the class. If the probability is high enough, it's flagged as an anomaly of class N and sent out for further anomaly detection and isolation. If the rectification system's probability output is too low (or more than 1 label has a similar probability), it's flagged for analyst review.

Does this make sense? It works well in most cases but I don't quite have the warm and fuzzy on the misclassification detection. It seems kind of nebulous when it comes to recognizing a known class, an anomalous sample of a known class, a new class, or a variant/evolution/subclass of a known class.

The output answers of these questions vegan pizza, vegan burger added pepperoni topping coke side topping did not satisfy me. Complementary and suggestion answers gave one quality and one poor quality output. Of course, these embed algorithms are usually based on conise similar. I suddenly had the suspicion that I should use embed for this type of rule based, match based, recommended. I believe that I can do the attached data with my own nlp libraries with more enrichment metadata tags without embedding. I would be glad if you share your ideas, especially if I can use llm in Out of vocabulary (OOV) detection contexts.

I’m thinking about using default rate and then adding to that the misclassified loan denials.

Would the only way to get the misclassified loan denials be to build a binary classification model, then validate it, after which to predict the repayment from all the denied instances that were never granted, and inference based on the created models performance how many of those are actually misclassified?

To look or not to look for a new job,1cc3pqe,"

I have been recently contemplating whether to look for a new job or not. I read somewhere to make a pros and cons list to figure out if I should. Here is my list, looking for some constructive feedback.

Pros:

* Job Security in an uncertain economy.
* Recently got promoted to senior DS, direct manager responsible for pushing for promotion.
* Work from home and pretty flexible working hours.
* Moved to a low cost city, but current salary based on high COL city.
* Some really good technical teammates to learn new technologies from, unfortunately they do not want to be managers, but prefer to be senior level ICs.
* Generally treated as a high performer.
* Slim chance of promotion if team members leave.
* Kids wouldn't have to move again, good school district.

Cons:

* Company financials not looking good, cash infusion from board, C-level suite revamped.
* No more merit based increases in the foreseeable future, freezing hire. No more promotions or career growth until company stabilizes.
* Direct Manager (female) was effectively stripped of role in departmental restructuring.
* Skip Manager (male) was initially not supportive of promotion and now is direct manager.
* Career growth looks non-existent, especially as a female, skip manager effectively made all white male middle managers during reorg.
* Working at fintech, there is not much innovation in terms of modeling, stuck with binary classification (default prediction) most of the time.
* Good at and interested in improving MLOps /MLE work (deploying models and improving infrastructure), but skip manager effectively delegated the women in the team to model delivery and put all the men in technical work. Also doesn’t recognize technical skillset.
* Looking for a new job would mean lower salaries based on general trend and recently moving to a low COL city.
* General dread of being typecast in fintech space with not a lot of exposure to other modeling techniques.
* Team culture is non-existent, especially with surviving 3 RIFs at company, and many key folks that held up the culture, leaving.
* Even after doing a good job of building responsible models that drive the core of the business, financials were not controlled correctly, leading to a lot of uncertainty in company future.
* Afraid of being the last one left, generally prefer to not change jobs often due to being on work visa , but also need the company to do well for security.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cc3pqe/to_look_or_not_to_look_for_a_new_job/,dsgirlie,2,Career Discussion,21,Top - month

Career advice regarding role transition.,1c75tlv,"I am currently a data scientist in a big bank. Overall my experience in my team was hell.

Some of my experiences were
1) bad stakeholders that bad mouth the analytics team. Stakeholders are very pushy and thus 5-6 month projects are compressed into 2 months. Effective we have a stakeholder from hell, and has a reputation for lynching managers. One of the managers i was on good terms I worked with effectively got lynched for things outside of their control. 

2)  i had an old manager that bad mouthed me as we didnt work well together then left. Manager was very toxic however any achievement is an uphill battle.

3) i ended up having to work a lot of hours, however i tried to draw boundaries to my team and ended up getting reprimand and my manager was essentially making my life a living hell and then put me on a pip.

4) I got crap for taking a sick leave due to a surgery despite telling them 3-4 months in advance.

5)our turnover is bad, we lose 1 data scientist a year if not more. 

6) my new manager effectively helps my coworkers but tells me to figure it our and does not i include me in meetings that are critical for my project. After withholding that information, in my touchbases with the manager she then criticizes my work for information that she witheld. 

However lately, they really fixed their attitude as i had to work extra hours to meet their deadlines while still looking for jobs. As of now they started adding more projects and tasks for me while I am in a pip. 

My pip was 6 weeks, and the manager slipped up saying the 8 week process. 6 weeks pip-2 weeks to be fired.

My personal guess is that they realized that I am not as bad as I am essentially the model janitor who fixes other people mistakes and when anything goes wrong I get blamed for it. A model is performing poorly, go rebuild it. This model has no documentation go rebuild it. This senior manager built an outrageously bad dataset go build it. 

Also i know critical dataset info and my own new manager does not know a lot of stuff on our data sources. While doing my job i was doing my managers job as she had no clue how to get any data or the problems with it.

Now that I have another offer with slightly more pay, but working in a startup i am strongly rethinking of just giving them the FU and leaving myself. However startups are risky and its not as prestigious as the bank. The benefits/PTO are worse (despite not being able to cash out or use pto in my current job for a year 7.5 weeks of pto unused), also given the bonuses and etc. its actually worse as the startup offers a static bonus of 7500 with 95000 base with my current role is 90,900 with 10% bonus, however i can feel they will still overwork me but i am considered to be very technical and start fresh.
The role offers more finance opportunities specific to risk modeling rather than pricing which i dont know if it will have major applications in other industries.

My friend and family are saying that its not worth it. While my current job effectively makes me get panic attacks, insomnia for months (i wake up in the middle of the night from the stress), and also i stayed for weeks not eating from stress.

The job is hell, and now the tone on is slightly better but i really dont trust my team as I think

Sorry if this is sound unhinged, but i finally got a ticket out and I wanted professional advice on how I would approach this situation.

Syllabus for school,1bzp8eg,"I'm involved in developing a syllabus in data science for young people (aged around 16). It will be defined at three levels (let's call it levels 1, 2 and 3). I'm happy with the data science content but would like guidance about the statistical content.

The course will be short (40 hours) so there's not a great deal of time for statistics, given that the focus of the course is data science (tools, techniques, methods, processes, etc.). However, there is some time (5 hours?) for some stats at each level.

At this time my inclination is:

Level 1: simple descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, max, min, range.

Level 2: Level 1 plus: percentiles, IQR.

Level 3: Level 2 plus: variance, standard deviation (z scores).

I'm tempted to introduce probability because it's fundamental to data science. What do you think about that? Also correlation?

Roast my Startup Idea - Tableau Version Control,1cftuh0,"Ok, so I currently work as a Tableau Developer/Data Analyst and I thought of a really cool business idea, born out of issues that I've encountered working on a Tableau team.

For those that don't know, Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence tool. PowerBI is its main competitor.

So, there is currently no version control capabilities in Tableau. The closest thing they have is *version history,* which just lets you revert a dashboard to a previously uploaded one. This is only useful if something breaks and you want to ditch all of your new changes.

.twb and .twbx (Tableau workbook files) are actually XML files under the hood. This means that you technically can throw them into GitHub to do version control with, there are certain aspects of ""merging"" features/things on a dashboard that would break the file. Also, there is no visual aspect to these merges, so you can't see what the dashboard would look like after you merge them.

Collaboration is another aspect that is severely lacking. If 2 people wanted to work on the same workbook, one would literally have to email their version to the other person, and the other person would have to manually rectify the changes between the 2 files. In terms of version control, Tableau is in the dark ages.

I'm not entirely sure how technically possible it would be to create a version control software based on the underlying XML, but based on what I've seen so far from the XML structure, it seems possible

Disclaimer, I am not currently working on this idea, I just thought of it and want to know what you think.

The business model would be B2B and it would be a SaaS business. Tableau teams would acquire/use this software the same way they use any other enterprise programming tool.

For the companies and teams that do use Tableau Server already, I think this would be a pretty reasonable and logical next purchase for their org. The target market for sales would be directors and managers who have the influence and ability to purchase software for their teams. The target users of the software would be tableau developers, data analysts, business intelligence developer, or really anyone who does any sort of reporting or visualization in Tableau.

So, what do you think of this business idea?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cftuh0/roast_my_startup_idea_tableau_version_control/,NFeruch,0,Tools,6,Top - month

I investigated the Underground Economy of Glassdoor Reviews,13ilm03,"Online company reviews are high stakes.

Top reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception.

Employers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious.

These reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place.

The scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs.

Whilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day.

In this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want “better” results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars.

The supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.

Many of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month.

Some of these run such sophisticated operations that they’ve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering.

Others operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they’re able to take a negative review down.

The underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we’re going to find out how it operates.

**Adding reviews**

The barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that’s where we’ll start.

To write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don’t need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address).

I went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company’s online presence.

Within minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:

https://preview.redd.it/esx3904qa20b1.png?width=3064&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff3a2f8528fee99aabb830f27ea71a7569ebb2e

After a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$10 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #2|$35 per original review, $20 per already created review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #3|$25 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #4|$25 per review|Monthly|10 reviews|
|Freelancer #5|$20 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Online Reputation Management Agency|$300 subscription|Monthly|8 reviews|

Let’s dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered.

Freelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n1ddox6cb20b1.png?width=2684&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c271d0eec4328cb78d7d2cb85dfffa3f9eb72f8

In another message, he tells me he’s offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:

5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month

Considering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that’s not bad change at all.

One of the companies that he’s offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won’t name the company, but here’s what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/2np5b6fdb20b1.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cafaa85453b0933a18eb5c30f931b3bb893c46

5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company’s total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad.

But here’s the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don’t look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don’t come in “spikes” – more on this later) and they also make sure that they’re not always leaving the “cons” section blank.

Don’t get me wrong, if you come across this company’s reviews, it’d be pretty easy to tell they’re quite strange. In fact, I can’t even post some screenshots here because it’d give the company away immediately.

But it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews.

The same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews.

Sidenote: I got curious about how he’s been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address – doesn’t Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP?

One of the freelancers answered my question:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4id2yqeb20b1.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2a77fdea8834a6d90f02b8b3eb67b3a874f3df2

Moving on – another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/99fdvcgfb20b1.png?width=3116&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e244529fc62b5c824d925feb61fd2cc16cbfd5

Based on this [Glassdoor webinar](https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2018, “if it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted” – so likely Glassdoor’s content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.

So far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:

* Spacing the fake reviews out
* Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)
* Using language that isn’t an obvious giveaway

On that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers’ first language is not English.

As an experiment, I turned to everybody’s favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review:

https://preview.redd.it/8w7cal9gb20b1.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=860c39b11c5813e8b7fabdbb038d73c565cc98cf

And I’d say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across.

**Removing reviews**

The process for removing an employer review usually works like this:

1. You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed
2. You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there’s something else about the review(s) that could get it removed.
3. You file an appeal to get it removed.

As an example, Glassdoor’s Review guidelines can be found [here](https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job). Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who’s not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.

Sounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6s8hsyac20b1.png?width=2036&format=png&auto=webp&s=f86c386f864198dc43faeb41faea378090c20107

After some research, I summarized the different vendors and prices in the table below:

&#x200B;

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|Self reported success rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$100 per review|3 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Freelancer #2|$30 per review|7 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #2|$450 per review|21 business days|Contingency Agreement Model|Unknown|
|Reputation management service #3|$1000 per review|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 1|$550 per review|5-6 weeks|Contingency Agreement Model|50-75%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 2|$300 Subscription + $100 per each review removed|Monthly service|Subscription plan|50-75%|
|Freelancer #3|$20|Undefined|Pay regardless|Undefined|
|Freelancer #4|$500|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|Undefined|

As you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed.

At one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).

**Analyzing reviews**

ReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter) that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is:

* A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews.
* Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons
* Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)

Whilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies’ reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.

After a couple of days, I have the ability to track review volume and review ratings over time for any company that I specify:

https://preview.redd.it/ehcbw2oje20b1.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=b448ff35eb9878fbb1686de2fa8cf031e4ed3e05

Let the games begin.

## Voluntary Response Bias

One of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias.

Research shows many of today’s most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.

Think about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.

On the other hand, if you’ve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.

Consider when a company goes through layoffs. You’re going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a “spike” in reviews.

**Note:** Just like the Wall Street Journal’s methodology described [here](https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0), I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.

Let’s take the company below. Here’s a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/n6kd9ejle20b1.png?width=3216&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eea2f3836617feca37eb88b1d3f67c8fa1b6fe2

In June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off).

Here’s another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4vcnr1ine20b1.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3877fb315ccc5d9a9294306a9f86616cb0fabd2

This company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.

**Note:** Glassdoor does state (based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their “give to get policy” has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized.

I can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don’t try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience.

## Goodhart’s Law

Goodhart’s law states the following:

*""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure""*

Every October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking.

In a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977) that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain & Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline.

I decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor’s 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.

One of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let’s refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.

Here is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4e656zkqe20b1.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=07141a66c56be7a6818efb9b1a4d912ee0021c91

FunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews.

FunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was \~75%.

Both the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.

I find it strange that Glassdoor’s proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor’s eligibility criteria for the award, it’s as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/hag04y7se20b1.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2b920e126a8ea42b40d35aaa55d5341e69d022

The goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect “authentic and unbiased reviews”.

Whilst there’s nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting ""unbiased and authentic"" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).

Glassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to “coerce” them. Examples of what you can’t do:

* Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.
* Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.
* Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.

It is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews.

They say that you shouldn’t hate the player but the game – I think **FunPlaceToWork** played by the rules, won fair and square, and that this is simply a perfect example of Goodhart’s Law.

I reached out to Glassdoor ([awards@glassdoor.com](mailto:awards@glassdoor.com)) about the above and this is the reply I got:

https://preview.redd.it/x0dqq39ue20b1.png?width=4800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0102c963be9486370b340f2f473cbc6650fc48a

**Conclusion**

When I was 22, on an [F1 visa with 3 months to find work](https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story), I didn’t give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I’d sign any piece of paper you put in front of me.

Compare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an “A-Player”, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews.

For most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there’s a concept of a “marketing touchpoint” - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.

Company reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn’t afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one.

After all, when others start to game the system, you’re at a disadvantage if you don’t. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.

HR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren’t always paying attention.

The result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy.

One that ends up hurting the job seeker.

Linear Regression is underrated,1avoc19,"Hey folks,

Wanted to share a quick story from the trenches of data science. I am not a data scientist but engineer however I've been working on a dynamic pricing project where the client was all in on neural networks to predict product sales and figure out the best prices using overly complicated setup. They tried linear regression once, didn't work magic instantly, so they jumped ship to the neural network, which took them days to train.

I thought, ""Hold on, let's not ditch linear regression just yet."" Gave it another go, dove a bit deeper, and bam - it worked wonders. Not only did it spit out results in seconds (compared to the days of training the neural networks took), but it also gave us clear insights on how different factors were affecting sales. Something the neural network's complexity just couldn't offer as plainly.

Moral of the story? Sometimes the simplest tools are the best for the job. Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees might seem too basic next to flashy neural networks, but it's quick, effective, and gets straight to the point. Plus, you don't need to wait days to see if you're on the right track.

So, before you go all in on the latest and greatest tech, don't forget to give the classics a shot. Sometimes, they're all you need.

Cheers!

"I posted for a Data Analyst, this is what you are competing against",13k8665,"Our org needs a new data analyst, so I wrote up a job description with the skillset I needed and passed it off to our HR director to do what she needed and post it. I didn't put any degree requirement on it, I put responsibilities and real tools the new hire would be expected to work with. It is a remote role. I started looking for the posting, but couldn't find it, so I asked for a copy because my LinkedIn was getting attention indicating it existed somewhere.

I expected this response if I had posted for a Data Scientist role, but I didn't. I posted for a Data Analyst.

She took it down. There were 255 applicants in less than 24 hours. She sifted through half of them, excluded those who weren't already authorized to work in the US and those who didn't show English proficiency through their resume, and then forwarded me 9. I don't know that the 9 was all of the viable candidates that remained, they did seem to be biased to areas we have a footprint in the US, and I had just requested a sample.

Of those 9, 3 were absolutely new to the field. They put a data analytics certificate, but didn't even list which of the languages indicated on the posting they already knew. They didn't list any projects, just their previous work history (which was at best adjacent to the field). I looked up their certificates quickly and then moved on. List your technical skills - I'm not looking for ""good attitude, can learn"", I want to know how you've gotten yourself started in ways that are relevant to what I need. Your certificate only matters in what it taught you, not that you have it.

I had 4 that were on point. They had the skills I had listed and then a few, and they either had relevant work experience or a history of coursework (online or through universities) that showed they would have a good framework to start from.

Two were overqualified. Their experience was legitimately as data engineers. I assume they actually read the posting, so they remain in consideration, but their skills are beyond the specifics I need. I can't justify paying them more unless I can find ways that benefit the org to use those extra skills. I assume they will drop themselves from consideration when we talk more, so if I were in a time crunch, I would cut them from my list. Wishful thinking on getting a unicorn isn't a good use of my time.

I figured this was an opportunity for some perspective, seeing that we get ""what do I need to do to get a role"" posts all the time. I don't know what response I would have received if I had region locked this to around our HQ, or if we were offering hybrid or on-site work.

Just to add - I am not accepting resumes through here. I'm also ignoring anyone who finds my or my coworkers' LinkedIns and sends us resumes outside the standard process. I've already seen those happen.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I also considered projects in the ""on point"" group - they showed they applied the skills.

Update: I checked with HR, the pay was included in the post. To be clear, it was mid-3rd quartile  for a Data Analyst position - we weren't posting anything with an amazing rate. It's very possible people submitted without reading the details, especially given the skill mismatches I see. I feel better about it, because I could not have written a more honest description of the role, so they had full information.

Also, 27 resumes were forwarded to me so far. I have sent 10 back for follow up, with another 5 to be written up on my side.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/13k8665/i_posted_for_a_data_analyst_this_is_what_you_are/,greenearrow,865,Career,285,Top - year
"Ever disassociate during job interviews because you feel like everything the company, and what you'll be doing, is just quickening the return to the feudal age?",12dhmus,"I was sitting there yesterday on a video call interviewing for a senior role.

Isn't that what nearly all models and algorithms are doing? More efficiently transferring wealth to the top few % of people and we get a relatively tiny cut of that in return? At some point, as housing, education and healthcare costs takes up a higher and higher % of everyone's paycheck (from 20% to 50%, eventually 85%) there will be so little wealth left to extract that our ""relatively"" tiny cut of 100-200k per year will become an absolutely tiny cut as well.

Make no mistake: I sacrificed my soul for this post. I created over 83 accounts and spent a total of 11 hours scrolling. I was originally going to do this for 500 companies, but wanted to chop my head off halfway.

I did this for a mix of companies – Fortune 500 to early stage startups, spread out across different industries from software to manufacturing. The *type* of role I applied to was kept constant: engineering / product focused.

The outcome? An average of over two and a half minutes per application—162 seconds of your life you'll never get back. But as we dig deeper, you'll discover that these 162 seconds only scratch the surface of an often maddening process.

*Key Takeaways*

* **Average Application Time:** On average, it took a bit over two and a half minutes to apply to a job.
* **Company Size Impact:** If company size doubles, the application time increases by 5%. If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%.
* **Industry Influence:** Being a government company is the single largest determinant of a long application, followed closely by aerospace and consulting firms.
* **Longest Application:** The longest application time went to the United States Postal Service (10 minutes and 12 seconds).
* **Shortest Application:** On the other hand, It took me just 17 seconds to apply to Renaissance Technologies.
* **ATS Impact:** Older ATS like Workday and Taleo make job applications as much as 128% longer.

Let's dive in.

# The Setup

There’s no real method to the 250 companies I pick. I’m just typing names into Google and trying to vary it up. Where does Trisha work? What was that billboard I saw? It's all up for grabs.

Here’s the distribution of the 250 companies by size:

https://preview.redd.it/gv6r6xoqvyxb1.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=6feb536781f5f892ff57aaed0033e716be4c25c4

Some examples of companies in each range:

* 1-500 → Glean, Quizlet, Gumroad
* 500-5,000 → Notion, Dolby, Moloco
* 5,000-50,000 → Airbnb, Genentech, Logitech
* 50,000-100,000 → HP, American Express, Pfizer
* 100,000+ → Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, General Motors

And here’s a look at the different types of industries represented:

I used a mix of Linkedin and Crunchbase for categorization.

# What makes a job application so frustrating

Generally speaking, the more frustrating a job application, the longer it takes to complete.

The three main factors that might influence how long a job application is (as measured in my data):

1. **Company size** → I would expect bigger companies to ask more questions.
2. **The ATS that is being used** → I would expect clunkier, older ATS to make job applications longer.
3. **Company industry** → I would expect more “traditional” industries to ask more questions.

We’re going to model the relationship between the above three factors and the amount of time it takes to complete a job application. To do this, we’re going to use a technique called linear regression.

Regression is about the way two measurements change together. It can help us make predictions.

For example, if I add 10 employees to a company, how many seconds will that add to the company’s job application process?

Since we have other factors like ATS and Industry, we will also account for those. For now, though, let’s just focus on each factor one by one.

# Company Size

Let’s first plot the data as is:

https://preview.redd.it/sdvfivrzvyxb1.png?width=3276&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d9d55db8d0fef37d0365c523a0c1ba7e3e4199

Yes, I know, this isn’t the most useful graph. I’m going to spruce it up real quick, I promise.

The United States Postal Service has a job application that took over 10 minutes to complete. Navigating their portal felt like using Internet Explorer in 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/40iu1ni2wyxb1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7b65699a39f2e4e3c3abadf38875280a673a0d7

Netflix’s application was just 20 seconds - their only mandatory requirements are your resume and basic info.

https://preview.redd.it/sl4fums4wyxb1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c0c87299460bd22163f34db1040a56ea3893059

Apple took me 71 seconds, still pretty fast for a company that has over 270,000 employees (PWC, which has a similar number of employees, took me almost six times as long).

Okay, back to the chart. There are a couple of problems with it.

First, the data is not linear. This is a problem if we want to use linear regression.

Second, the company size scale is hard to interpret because of the many data points clumped together near zero (representing all the smaller companies).

We can resolve both these issues with the following insight:

There is a big difference between going from 10 to 100 employees and, say, 10,000 to 10,100 employees. The first represents major changes in company structure: you might actually hire a proper HR team, a bunch of recruiters, and build out your candidate experience. The second, though, is pretty much just business as usual - think of a multinational opening up a satellite office or a regular month of hiring.

Since we want to account for this, our data is better suited to a log scale than a linear scale. I will also transform our Y-axis, the application time, to a log scale because it helps normalize the data.

If we plot both our variables on a log-log scale, we get the below chart:

https://preview.redd.it/5l4po6d8wyxb1.png?width=4304&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3199197ea1b608fc39b8c3626ab994dc9d5eb5e

Better right? This is the same data as the last chart, but with different axes that fits the data better, we observe a linear relationship.

We have the usual suspects in the top right: Government organizations, professional services firms, and some of the tech industry dinosaurs.

The variance in application times across smaller companies, like startups, is interesting. For example, many of the startups with longer application times (e.g OpenAI, Posthog, Comma.AI) reference that they are looking for “exceptional” candidates on their careers page. (Note that OpenAI has changed its application since I last analyzed it - it’s now much faster, but when I went through they asked for a mini essay on why you’re exceptional).

One thing that I was expecting to see was competitors mirroring each other’s application times. This is most closely represented with the consulting firms like Deloitte, E&Y, KPMG, etc all clumped together. McKinsey and Bain, the two most prestigious consulting firms, have applications that take longer to complete.

This doesn’t necessarily seem to be the case with the FAANG companies.

We can also calculate the correlation coefficient for this graph. This is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The closer to 1 the value, the stronger the relationship.

For the above data, we get a correlation coefficient of 0.58, which is a moderate to strong association.

Note that on its own, this doesn't tell us anything about causation. But it does start to point us in some type of direction.

It's not rocket science: big companies ask for more stuff. Sometimes they ask for the last 4 digits of your SSN.

https://preview.redd.it/c7g5717bwyxb1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c776e46d45d179a6627ba3470fd4f89ca04204

Sometimes they even ask if you’d be okay going through a polygraph:

https://preview.redd.it/1q52rzldwyxb1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3b8921e055d38e04ee7395e9b982fa50c38f9df

An argument here is that if big companies didn’t have some sort of barriers in their application process, they’d get swarmed with applications.

Consider the fact that Google gets 3 million applications every year. Deloitte gets 2 million. Without some sort of initial friction in the application process, those numbers would be even higher. That friction almost serves as a reliable filter for interest.

If you’re an employer, you don’t really care about the people using a shotgun approach to apply. You want the candidates that have a real interest in the position. On the other hand, if you’re a candidate, the reality is such that the shotgun approach to apply is arguably the most efficient.

So we have this inherent tension between companies and candidates. Candidates want the most bang for their buck, companies don’t want thousands of irrelevant resumes.

And in the middle, we have the plethora of application tracking software that can often be quite old and clunky.

# ATS

Everytime I came face to face with a company that used Workday as their ATS, I died a bit inside. This is because Workday makes you:

1. create a new account every single time
2. redirects you away from the careers page

I defined a redirect as one when the job description is not listed on the same page as the first input box part of the application.

This isn’t a perfectly accurate measure, but it does allow us to differentiate between the modern ATS like Greenhouse and older ones like Workday.

With every ATS, I implicitly had some type of “how easy is this going to be” metric in my head.

We can try to represent this “how easy is this going to be” metric a bit more concretely using the matrix below.

https://preview.redd.it/bvpeu47iwyxb1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=818191eb4a0a5924c582f3ad7ec9539bc510f6fa

Ideally, you want the ATS to be in the bottom left corner. This creates an experience that is low friction and fast.

If we plot application time versus ATS, this is what we get:

https://preview.redd.it/pe9zyxmkwyxb1.png?width=3184&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df5c1118f9f0044e2154c8ae63816332ca42d67

The ATS that don’t make you create an account and don’t redirect you are tied to lower application times than the ones that do.

One possibility is that certain companies are more likely to use certain ATS. Big companies might use Workday for better compliance reporting. Same with the industry - maybe B2C software companies use the newer ATS on the market. These would be confounding variables, meaning that we may misinterpret a relationship between the ATS and the application time when in fact there isn’t one (and the real relationship is tied to the industry or size).

So to properly understand whether the ATS actually has an effect on application time, we need to control for our other variables. We’ll do this in the final section when we run a regression including all our variables.

One of the big frustrations surrounding different ATS is that when you upload your resume, you then need to retype out your experience in the boxes because the ATS resume parser did it incorrectly. For example, I went to UC Berkeley but sometimes got this:

https://preview.redd.it/ay21vccnwyxb1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=9862b0860c49c87a76b02218f8e4118134acfb89

The only resume parser that didn't seem abysmal was the one from Smart Recruiters. TikTok's resume parser also isn't bad.

Another frustrating experience is tied to inconsistency between the company I'm applying to and the ATS.

https://preview.redd.it/9xzq21vpwyxb1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=8432b293be4db0f58770760097df0117b53e667e

A company’s application process is often the first touchpoint you have with their brand. Startups competing for the best talent can't afford extra steps in their process. Apple and Facebook can.

Whilst the average time to complete a job application may only be 162 seconds, the fact that many ATS require steps like account creation and authentication can lead to application fatigue.

It’s not necessarily the explicit amount of time it takes, it’s the steps involved that drain you of energy and make you want to avoid applying to new jobs.

# Industry

Okay, so far we’ve looked at company size and the ATS as a loose indicator of what might make a job application frustrating. What about the company industry?

You would expect industries like banking or professional services to have longer application times, because getting those jobs revolves around having a bunch of credentials which they likely screen for (and ask you to submit) early on in the process.

On the other hand, internet startups I’d expect to be quick and fast. Let’s find out if this is true.

https://preview.redd.it/i7825ssvwyxb1.png?width=4012&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f51989a663cf7b8c664eacb983a9be0a8dbc80b

Hyped up industries like AI and Crypto have shorter application times. As expected, banks and consulting firms care about your GPA and ask you to submit it.

A government company has to basically verify your identity before they can even receive your application, so the process is entirely different and reflected in the submission time.

For many technology companies, the application process is almost like an extension of the company’s brand itself. For example, Plaid (an API first Fintech company), has a neat option where you can actually apply to the job via API:

https://preview.redd.it/px5k5wwxwyxb1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d669e7e47e77e51d48a4867a2d06d27125617ed8

Roblox, a gaming company, allows people to submit job applications from within their [games](https://gamerant.com/roblox-company-interview-job-applicants-in-game/).

We also notice differences between legacy companies and their newer competitors. If we compare legacy banks versus neobanks (like Monzo, Mercury, etc), the legacy players averaged around 250 seconds per job application whereas the neobanks averaged less than 60 seconds.

If you can’t compete on prestige, you need to find other ways. One of those ways can be through asking for less information upfront.

# Putting it together

Now that we've analyzed each variable - the company size, ATS, and the industry - to understand the separate relationship of each to application time, we can use linear regression to understand the *combined* relationships.

This will allow us to determine what factors actually have an impact on the job application time versus which ones might just have had one when we looked at them in isolation.

After some number crunching in R, I get the following results (I’ve only added the statistically significant factors – the ones with the “strongest evidence”):

https://preview.redd.it/g2pg1o11xyxb1.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=2efc92ad2cfa4aaf25297d23c228d0c7343729f9

Here’s how you can interpret some of the information above:

* When a job app is for a company that is within the Government industry, the submission time goes up by 366% (assuming the size and ATS are constant). For the aerospace industry, this is 249% (and so on).
* When a job app is for a company using the Workday ATS, the submission times goes up by 128% (assuming the size and industry are constant). For the Phenom ATS, this is 110% (and so on).
* Our only (statistically significant) metric which seems to make job applications faster is the Lever ATS (42% shorter).

Okay, now what about company size?

Well, first up: company size is indeed statistically significant. So there is an effect.

However, its effect is not as strong as most of our other variables. To be precise, here are some ways to interpret our company size coefficient:

* If company size doubles, the app size increases by 5%
* If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%

This is a smaller effect size compared to ATS or industry (a 20% increases in app time for a 10x large company is a qualitatively smaller effect size than e.g. a 100% increase in app time for Taleo ATS). So although company size is statistically significant, it is not as strong of a driver as ATS and industry of app time.

# Wrapping it up

Two and a half minutes might not be too long, but it can feel like an eternity when you’re forced to answer the same questions and upload the same documents. Over and over again.

Think about catching a flight. All you want is to get on the jet. Hawaii awaits.

But first: the security line. You have to take your shoes off. You get patted down and your bag gets searched. The gate numbers don’t make sense. And then at the end of it, your flight’s delayed. Congrats.

Applying to a job can feel similar. All you want to do is say aloha to the hiring manager, a real human being.

To even have the remote possibility of making that happen, you need to create an account and password, check your email, retype your entire resume, tell them the color of your skin, and explain why this company you’ve never heard of before is the greatest thing on Earth.

And for what? Most likely for the privilege of receiving an automated email about two weeks later rejecting you.

If we make it tiring and unappealing to look for new opportunities, then we prevent people from doing their best work.

But what would a world where applying took just a few seconds actually look like? Recruiters would get bombarded with resumes. It's possible to argue that job applications taking so long is a feature, not a bug. You get to filter for intent and narrow down your application pool.

Is it fair to shift the burden of screening unqualified candidates onto good candidates that now need to provide so much information? Shouldn’t that burden fall on the recruiter?

The truth is that applying to a job via the careers page is a bit of a rigged game. The odds are not in your favor.

Sometimes, though, all you need is to only be right once.

A data scientist got caught lying about their project work and past experience during interview today,1bj9cvc,"I was part of an interview panel for a staff data science role. The candidate had written a really impressive resume with lots of domain specific project work experience about creating and deploying cutting-edge ML products. They had even mentioned the ROI in millions of dollars. The candidate started talking endlessly about the ML models they had built, the cloud platforms they'd used to deploy, etc. But then, when other panelists dug in, the candidate could not answer some domain specific questions they had claimed extensive experience for. So it was just like any other interview.

One panelist wasn't convinced by the resume though. Turns out this panelist had been a consultant at the company where the candidate had worked previously, and had many acquaintances from there on LinkedIn as well. She texted one of them asking if the claims the candidate was making were true. According to this acquaintance, the candidate was not even part of the projects they'd mentioned on the resume, and the ROI numbers were all made up. Turns out the project team had once given a demo to the candidate's team on how to use their ML product.

When the panelist shared this information with others on the panel, the candidate was rejected and a feedback was sent to the HR saying the candidate had faked their work experience.

This isn't the first time I've come across people ""plagiarizing"" (for the lack of a better word) others' project works as their's during interview and in resumes. But this incident was wild. But do you think a deserving and more eligible candidate misses an opportunity everytime a fake resume lands at your desk? Should HR do a better job filtering resumes?

Edit 1: Some have asked if she knew the whole company. Obviously not, even though its not a big company. But the person she connected with knew about the project the candidate had mentioned in the resume. All she asked was whether the candidate was related to the project or not. Also, the candidate had already resigned from the company, signed NOC for background checks, and was a immediate joiner, which is one of the reasons why they were shortlisted by the HR. 

Edit 2: My field of work requires good amount of domain knowledge, at least at the Staff/Senior role, who're supposed to lead a team. It's still a gamble nevertheless, irrespective of who is hired, and most hiring managers know it pretty well. They just like to derisk as much as they can so that the team does not suffer. As I said the candidate's interview was just like any other interview except for the fact that they got caught. Had they not gone overboard with exxagerating their  experience, the situation would be much different.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bj9cvc/a_data_scientist_got_caught_lying_about_their/,OverratedDataScience,776,Discussion,337,Top - year
Anyone else been mildly horrified once they dive into the company's data?,13o7m3d,"I'm a few months into my first job as a data analyst at a mobile gaming company. We make freemium games where users can play for awhile until they run out of coins/energy then have to wait varying amounts of time, like ""You're out of coins. Wait 10 minutes for new coins, or you can buy 100 coins now for $12.99.""

So I don't know what I was expecting, but the first time I saw how much money some people spend on these games I felt like I was going to throw up. Most people never make a purchase. But some people spend insane amounts of money. Like upsetting amounts of money.

There's one lady in Ohio who spent so much money that her purchases alone could pay for the salaries of our entire engineering department. And I guess they did?

There's no scenario in which it would make sense for her to spend that much money on a mobile game. Genuinely I'm like, the only way I would not feel bad for this lady is if she's using a stolen credit card and fucking around because it's not really her money.

Anyone else ever seen things like this while working as a data analyst?

\*Edit: Interesting that the comment section has both people saying-

1. Of course the numbers are that high; ""whales"" spend a lot of money on mobile games.
2. The numbers can't possibly be that high; it must be money laundering or pipeline failures.

A small rant - The quality of data analysts / scientists,14k6qt5,"I work for a mid size company as a manager and generally take a couple of interviews each week, I am frankly exasperated by the shockingly little knowledge even for folks who claim to have worked in the area for years and years.

&#x200B;

1. People would write stuff like LSTM , NN , XGBoost etc. on their resumes but have zero idea of what a linear regression is or what p-values represent. In the last 10-20 interviews I took, not a single one could answer why we use the value of 0.05 as a cut-off (Spoiler - I would accept literally any answer ranging from defending the 0.05 value to just saying that it's random.)
2.  Shocking logical skills, I tend to assume that people in this field would be at least somewhat competent in maths/logic, apparently not - close to half the interviewed folks can't tell me how many cubes of side 1 cm do I need to create one of side 5 cm.
3. Communication is exhausting - the words ""explain/describe **briefly**"" apparently doesn't mean shit - I must hear a story from their birth to the end of the universe if I accidently ask an open ended question.
4. Powerpoint creation / creating synergy between teams doing data work is not data science - please don't waste people's time if that's what you have worked on unless you are trying to switch career paths and are willing to start at the bottom.
5. Everyone claims that they know ""**advanced excel**"" , knowing how to open an excel sheet and apply =SUM(?:?) is not advanced excel - you better be aware of stuff like offset / lookups  / array formulas / user created functions / named ranges etc. if you claim to be advanced.
6. There's a massive problem of not understanding the ""**why?**"" about anything - why did you replace your missing values with the medians and not the mean? Why do you use the elbow method for detecting the amount of clusters? What does a scatter plot tell you (hint - In any real world data it doesn't tell you shit - I will fight anyone who claims otherwise.) - they know how to write the code for it, but have absolutely zero idea what's going on under the hood.

There are many other frustrating things out there but I just had to get this out quickly having done 5 interviews in the last 5 days and wasting 5 hours of my life that I will never get back.

However, the primary update that is subtle is the use of Apache Arrow API vs. Numpy for managing and ingesting data (using methods like read\_csv, read\_sql, read\_parquet, etc). This new integration is hope to increase efficiency in terms of memory use and improving the usage of data types such string,  datatime, and categories.  


>Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc) are very slow and can't be used. So the data representation is not Python and is not standard, and an implementation needs to happen via Python extensions, usually implemented in C (also in C++, Rust and others). For many years, the main extension to represent arrays and perform operations on them in a fast way has been NumPy. And this is what pandas was initially built on.  
>  
>While NumPy has been good enough to make pandas the popular library it is, it was never built as a backend for dataframe libraries, and it has some important limitations.

**Summary of improvements include:**

* **Managing missing values:** By using Arrow, pandas is able to deal with missing values without having to implement its own version for each data type. Instead, the Apache Arrow in-memory data representation includes an equivalent representation as part of its specification
* **Speed:** Given an example of a dataframe with 2.5 million rows running in the author's laptop, running the `endswith` function is 31.6x fasters using Apache Arrow vs. Numpy (14.9ms vs. 471ms, respectively)
* **Interoperability:** Ingesting a data in one format and outputting it in a different format should not be challenging. For example, moving from SAS data to Latex, using Pandas <2.0 would require:
   * Load the data from SAS into a pandas dataframe
   * Export the dataframe to a parquet file
   * Load the parquet file from Polars
   * Make the transformations in Polars
   * Export the Polars dataframe into a second parquet file
   * Load the Parquet into pandas
   * Export the data to the final LATEX file  
However, with PyArrow, the operation can be as simple as such (after Polars bug fixes and using Pandas 2.0):

&#8203;

    loaded_pandas_data = pandas.read_sas(fname) 
    
    polars_data = polars.from_pandas(loaded_pandas_data) 
    # perform operations with pandas polars 
    
    to_export_pandas_data = polars.to_pandas(use_pyarrow_extension_array=True) to_export_pandas_data.to_latex()

* **Expanding Data Type Support:**

>Arrow types are broader and better when used outside of a numerical tool like NumPy. It has better support for dates and time, including types for date-only or time-only data, different precision (e.g. seconds, milliseconds, etc.), different sizes (32 bits, 63 bits, etc.). The boolean type in Arrow uses a single bit per value, consuming one eighth of memory. It also supports other types, like decimals, or binary data, as well as complex types (for example a column where each value is a list). There is [a table](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/arrays.html?highlight=arrowdtype#pyarrow) in the pandas documentation mapping Arrow to NumPy types.

I am Jack's Complete Lack of Job Satsifaction,1bcpfuc,"I was hired so they could have a data person. Half the time they call me a data scientist, the rest of the time it's either data analyst or data guru.
But they have only a teeny amount of data with a ravenous hyena guarding it like gollum with his precious. 
They pay me decently to rot away doing nothing. No access to data and no access to customers.  It's been almost a year, I've taken dozens of courses on everything data-related. I've read books, articles, white papers. Nothing is sticking anymore, without application, I'm not retaining what I'm trying to learn.
Some days are worse than others, like today, staring at the screen in a mindless haze. Watching my life get closer to the end, one minute at a time.
I'm losing my will to live in this entropic ennui. 
I can't even read job descriptions with any amount of interest.

It's not just you. Everyone hates the return to office,16vaaco,"Somehow, I am lucky enough to land a completely remote role, 100% virtual because the rest of my team is virtual based but I still have to go into the office at least 12 times a year for bogus meetings to sit in a conference room while we all use WebEx, totally immersive right? But we have frequent meetings with other people in our field, data scientists, engineers, architects, etc. They are all back in office 4 days a week, and each of them has this ashy tone, they grudgingly hate being in the office, despise it, because who wants to go to a stuffy office?


Here are the top complaints that I have noticed from people about being in office

- The commute is terrible. Some people have to commute as much as 50 minutes one way, and that's not including traffic. That's crazy. You're not getting paid for that. That's free labor and travel for your company


- The office is incredibly distracting. Cubicles are typically open, so people can freely walk up and talk to you, make eye contact with you which starts a conversation, but you're still under the same time crunch you were when you worked from home completely isolated in your nice office away from everyone else


- ""Collaborative spaces"" and ""focus areas"" are bullsh*t. So many nice little desks, nooks, rooms for you to go to to focus or meet with others. But here's the thing, you never see anyone using those because I guess where they are? At their desk, working, constantly. No one ever has the time to use them. My office is so incredibly nice, and every time I walk around, I feel like I'm the only one taking a walk because I see everyone glued to their desks

- You're distracted constantly by others who are at different levels than you. The only way I figured out that there is some college intern making twice as much as I am doing a little bit more than me is by speaking to people in the immediate vicinity of my desk. Machine learning engineer versus data scientist. The difference? They use a little bit more power platform, a couple more tools, 20 more lines of Python a day. Congrats, here is 40K more for you. This can be very distracting, because you see these people all the time


- NO PRODUCTIVITY OR OTHER GAIN. Literally no benefit or gain from being back in the office. Just disgruntled people


- office supplies are shit. At home, I have an ultra wide monitor that I also use for personal PC gaming so I can just literally KVM switch it over. I have a modded gaming mouse and keyboard, a $200 Logitech pro headset with superior sound quality and microphone. You know what I don't have at the office? Any of this stuff. Yeah. A $5 Logitech mouse and keyboard that is extremely noisy and uncomfortable has no ergonomics at all. Office chairs are not ergonomic They are just the cheapest they could get. Uncomfortable $0.90 headsets and webcams


- MANDATORY extracurricular events and activities in or outside of work. Yes, this is real. After hours socials, restaurants, social outings. These are disguised as optional, but you will often get bullied teased or pressured into them. This also does not grant you any leeway during any project, you still have to get all work and projects done with this loss of time",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16vaaco/its_not_just_you_everyone_hates_the_return_to/,databro92,652,Discussion,257,Top - year
Warning to would be master’s graduates in “data science”,17798wz,"I teach data science at a university (going anonymous for obvious reasons). I won't mention the institution name or location, though I think this is something typical across all non-prestigious universities. Basically, master's courses in data science, especially those of 1 year and marketed to international students, are a scam. 

Essentially, because there is pressure to pass all the students, we cannot give any material that is too challenging. I don't want to put challenging material in the course because I want them to fail--I put it because challenge is how students **grow** and **learn**. Aside from being a data analyst, being even an entry-level data scientist requires being good at a lot of things, and knowing the material deeply, not just superficially. Likewise, data engineers have to be good software engineers.

But apparently, asking the students to implement a trivial function in Python is too much. Just working with high-level libraries won't be enough to get my students a job in the field. OK, maybe you don’t have to implement algorithms from scratch, but you have to at least wrangle data. The theoretical content is OK, but the practical element is far from sufficient.

It is my belief that only one of my students, a software developer, will go on to get a high-paying job in the data field. Some might become data analysts (which pays thousands less), and likely a few will never get into a data career.

Universities write all sorts of crap in their marketing spiel that bears no resemblance to reality. And students, nor parents, don’t know any better, because how many people are actually qualified to judge whether a DS curriculum is good? Nor is it enough to see the topics, you have to see the *assignments*. If a DS course doesn’t have at least one serious course in statistics, any SQL, and doesn’t make you solve real programming problems, it's no good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17798wz/warning_to_would_be_masters_graduates_in_data/,anon_throwaway09557,649,Discussion,313,Top - year

A harsh truth about data science....,1arg0lv,"Broadly speaking, the job of a data scientist is to use data to understand things, create value, and inform business decisions. It it *not necessarily* to implement and utilize advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. That's not to say that you can't or won't use ML/AI to inform business decisions, what I'm saying is that it's not always required to. Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.

I think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away. They apply them anywhere they can, kind of shoehorning them in and not having a clear idea of what it is they are even trying to accomplish in the first place. In other words, the tools lead the problem. Of course, the way it should be is that the problem leads the tools. I'm coming to find for like 50+% of the things I'm asked to do, a time series visualization, contingency tables, and histograms are sufficient to answer the question to the satisfaction of the business leaders. That's it. We're done, on to the next one. Start simple, if the simple techniques don't answer the question, then move on to the more advanced stuff. I speak from experience, of course.

In my opinion, understanding when to use simple tools vs when to break out the big guns is way harder then figuring out how to use the big guns. Even harder still is taking your findings and translating them into actual, actionable insights that a business can use. Okay, so you built a multi-layer CNN that models customer behavior? That's great, but what does the business do with it? For example, can you use it to identify customers who might buy more product with more advertising? Can you put a list of those customers on the CEO's desk? Could a simple regression model have done the same in 1/4 of the time? These are skills that take years to learn and so it's totally understandable for newer or prospective DSs to not have them. But they do not seem to be emphasized in a lot of degree programs or MOOCs. It seems to me like they just hand you a dataset and tell you what to do with it. It's great that you can use the tools they tell you to on it, but you're missing out on the identifying which tools to even use part in the first place.

Just my 2c.

125k offer as a data scientist but I have no idea what a data scientist does,186id1x,"Hey so I recently got a new grad job offer as a data scientist with TC about 125k in Dallas, Texas. But I have never really done data science before in my life and I'm a little worried about going in there and just complete flopping.

6 months as a Data Science freelancer,17tit0r,"I have been a freelance Data Scientist for 6 month and I have more job offers than I can manage (I turn down offers every week). 

Some people have written me to get some tips on how to start and get some clients. 
So these are a few things I tried to find clients on Upwork, LinkedIn and in online communities.

1) Look for projects on Upwork. 
Set up a nice profile, showcase your project portfolio, research the market, bid on several projects and be willing to set a cheap rate at the beginning. 
You won't make much money the first month, but you will get exposure, your Upwork rating will improve and you can start to bid on some higher paying jobs. 
In 6 months my rate went up 4 times, so don't think it takes so long to get to a good hourly rate. 

2) Improve and polish your LinkedIn profile. 
Many recruiters will write you here. 
Insert the right keywords on your profile, document your previous work, post something work related every week, if you can. 
This is a long game but pays off because instead of bidding for jobs, in the end the recruiters will start to write you.

3) Join online communities of entrepreneurs.
There are several small businesses that look for Data experts and beyond. They have projects ongoing and want to hire freelancers for a short time. 
You can meet them in these communities. Look for them on Twitter, Discord, Slack, Reddit...
Engage with them, share what you do and soon you will start to get some interest. This type of interaction quickly turns into job opportunities.

4) Write. 
Just create a blog and post regularly. Post about what you do, the tools you have used and so on. Better to post a tutorial, a new tech you tried out, a small model you developed. 
All the successful people I know have this habit. They write and share what they do regularly.

5) Put yourself out there and interact online. 
Maybe one day you share something and it gets retweeted, maybe you pick up a good SEO keyword in your blog, you never know. That's why it's important to increase your exposure. You will increase your chances of getting noticed and potentially land a new client.

6) Be generous 
Once you do the above soon you will be noticed and people will start to contact you. 
They will not offer you a contract. That's not how it works. after all, they don't know you and they don't trust you. But something you wrote hit them. Probably they will ask for your help and advice on a specific issue. 
Give advice on the tech to use, how to solve a problem, how to improve their processes, give as much as you can, be honest and open. Say all you know and you will build trust. 
It's the start of a professional relationship.

7) Be patient
Not all conversations will turn into a job opportunity. Sometimes they lead nowhere, sometimes there is no budget, sometimes it takes months to sign a contract. In my experience maybe 2-3 out of 10 conversations turn into a job offer. 
Accept it. It's normal.

Name & Shame: Carlyle Group Investment Data Science,1bnmif0,"I think we're due for a name & shame! Sharing my experience in case it's helpful for future applicants.

# Company & Role

The Carlyle Group is a Private Equity mega-fund. They essentially buy and flip companies like a real estate investor buys and flips houses. They've recently (in the past few years) spun up a data science org. My understanding is that the responsibilities of this role would entail assisting the deal team in commercial due diligences of prospective investments, assisting in portfolio operations and consulting on advanced analytics for the portfolio companies, as well as company wide data science initiatives. My impression was that this role would not be very involved in deal sourcing.

# My Background

* FAANG Senior DS
* Worked in management consulting in the past - primarily as a data science consultant for Silicon Valley tech companies but also did a commercial due diligence project with our M&A practice as a DS consultant
* Ivy League masters in CS / Top 20 undergrad

# Application Process & Experience

* I first cold applied online
* After a short period of time I received an email from a Carlyle recruiter with a link to a 2 hour Hackerrank exam. I did not first receive any introductory call or even an introductory email - just an email with a URL to Hackerrank.
* I decided to take the exam. It consisted of:
   * One SQL (medium / window functions)
   * One Python (leetcode easy)
   * Discrete probability (e.g. probability of making a full house if you randomly draw 5 cards from a standard deck)
   * Domain specific data science questions (e.g. how would you apply data science to this private equity problem)
   * Overall I felt comfortable with all aspects of the exam and felt that it was well within my wheelhouse
* After completing the exam I sent a note to the recruiter. They scheduled a call with the ""senior recruiter"" for end of week
* The call with senior recruiter was fairly standard and covered the nature of the team, responsibilities of the role, and my background. I thought the call went well and was under the impression that I'd be moving forward in the process  (though I've learned never to take what recruiters say at face value)
* At the end of the call the senior recruiter asked if I had taken the Hackerrank exam yet. I was a bit surprised that they did not already know the answer to that question.
* After exactly one week of radio silence since the initial call, I emailed the first recruiter to let them know that I had seen some progress in my other searches (true) and asked if my application was still in consideration. I did not receive a response to this email.
* I waited one more week (two weeks since the initial call and about three weeks since I took the exam) and emailed the senior recruiter for a status update. I didn't receive a response to this email either but will edit this post if they ever do respond.

# Conclusion

* At this point I've concluded that I've been ghosted. I can only speculate as to why. I'm leaning towards them just being highly disorganized.
* For future applicants I strongly, strongly advise not taking their HackerRank exam unless you don't mind having your time wasted. I'm willing to bet nobody at Carlyle even looked at my test responses.

\*\*EDIT\*\*

It seems a lot of you think that ghosting is professionally acceptable. If you're investing your time, the bare minimum is a courtesy email to let you know you won't be moving forward in the process.

My F100 company analyzed why our good data scientists are good and here's the recap,16x6t1p,"A small team of internal researchers inside the company spent time investigating which data scientists preformed the best, which preformed the worst, and what factors played into this. 

The top 3 indicators of a high preforming data scientist were:
1. The number one predictor of a preformant data scientist was proactive communication. Be it speaking up in meetings, pinging people in chat, voicing concerns with a work plan, these data scientists communicated on their own initiative and their ability to get things done and make an impact is recognized. 
2. They are capable of flushing out requirements and working on complicated tasks without managerial intervention. A good example of this could be manager says we need to build a model that satisfies xyz objectives and that there are additional business reqs we'll need to flush out. 2 or 3 data scientists go do all the work to get the data and flush out the requirments while making all the plans amongst themselves and basically just keeping the manager in the loop on what's happening. 
3. They focus on adding value over pursuing technical solutions. Often times the simpler modeling approach is good enough and it solves the problem in a quick fashion. 


Things noted about low preforming data scientists were:
1. They were reactive in their communication
2. They often times missed deadlines that they themselves set and never communicated that there were issues or that the deadline would be missed. 
3. They often focus on tasks like attending all of their meetings or immediatly responding to emails rather than meeting project goals and deadlines
4. They focus too much on perfecting the POC solution which later leads to a lot of rework / wasted time.
5. They're overly dismissive in their communication. Weather it be asking for feedback and validation and then disregarding it when it doesn't align with their ideas or simply dismissing the ideas of others in general. 
6. They create drama.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16x6t1p/my_f100_company_analyzed_why_our_good_data/,None,492,Discussion,176,Top - year

R vs Python - detailed examples from proficient bilingual programmers,16dk5b6,"As an academic, R was a priority for me to learn over Python. Years later, I always see people saying ""Python is a general-purpose language and R is for stats"", but I've never come across a single programming task that couldn't be completed with extraordinary efficiency in R. I've used R for everything from big data analysis (tens to hundreds of GBs of raw data), machine learning, data visualization, modeling, bioinformatics, building interactive applications, making professional reports, etc.

Is there any truth to the dogmatic saying that ""Python is better than R for general purpose data science""? It certainly doesn't appear that way on my end, but **I would love some specifics for how Python beats R in certain categories as motivation to learn the language.** For example, if R is a statistical language and machine learning is rooted in statistics, how could Python possibly be any better for that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16dk5b6/r_vs_python_detailed_examples_from_proficient/,Every-Eggplant9205,489,Discussion,144,Top - year

Recently, I see a lot of people saying they can’t get DS jobs. Here is the thing, most businesses need a lot more DA then DS. There are so many more basic data needs then complex ones. Most companies I’ve worked for have a ratio of about 5:1 DA to DS. Unless you’re a really strong and savvy DS candidate (smarter then me) you’re probably better off doing DA or SWE.

I don't want to be a Data Scientist Anymore,149ea3x,"Wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to read my thread. 

I'm almost 30 years old, and have been in the same career for 8 years. I'm a ""Data Scientist"" with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics & a Minor in CS. My day to day as a Data Scientist is a collection of building/testing/implementing SQL procedures, fitting simple models (Linear Models, Regression Trees, etc.), implementing model results as live models, delivering analysis to decision makers & executives. I work for a major financial institution. 

Here's the problem : I feel so disconnected & unpassionate about my job. It's partially an imposter syndrome issue. Looking at my skillset compared to other data scientists & those who are passionate about Data Science - I'm losing pace. My peers who care about this type of work are deeply involved in improved learning - new Python libraries, new modeling techniques. Everyone in this profession have a strong desire to learn & improve. This has really never been me. I was able to succeed in the mid to late 2010's being fresh out of school & having an ""up to date"" skillset ... but I don't think I have the drive or desire to do what I have to do to keep up in the mid to late 2020's.  

I feel like I fell into this career out of the start of my career, but now a few months away from 30 I'm questioning if this is what I want my next 25 years of work to be. I have friends, family and colleagues who are passionate & driven about work. I feel like this was the career I fell into because of my Math degree. I really don't know what it is I'm passionate about, but working as a data scientist in the financial sector for the next 25 years isn't it (or maybe being a data scientist at all). 

At the same time, I don't want to start my career fresh at the age of 30. I think I'm a naturally analytical person, and want to be able to carry over some of the skills I've picked up from the last 8 years into a new role, that might bring more passion & joy back into my job. 

So, I wanted to see if others on this sub have gone through the same thing. If yes - what were some stories you have that I can use as inspiration? Are there career options out there for ex Data Scientists who don't want to be technical code monkeys anymore, that can leverage some of our analytical backgrounds to thrive?

Thanks, look forward to hearing some stories",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/149ea3x/i_dont_want_to_be_a_data_scientist_anymore/,I_am_Howie_Dewitt,465,Discussion,220,Top - year
Interviewing is terrible now. They don't treat you with any respect anymore,1802ydm,"I was laid off from my company earlier this year after 1.8 years of successful work experience at this company. I was recognized three times over that period, given merit increases in bonuses, shares of stock as rewards. Constantly praised and recognized several times, and never disciplined in any way or even told that my performance was an issue. I was laid off and they admitted that it was not for performance reasons, I was a great employee, they would love to see me work for them again...

So I start reapplying, I'm very dedicated to working for this company, and the interviews that I get are much more challenging than they were when I started with the company. Previously, they asked me about my background, skills, experience, and had me interview with other people on the team. This time around, I had to do case studies that were extremely challenging. One of them I had 3 hours to go through an absurdly complex Excel assignment that involved three separate spreadsheets of data and building a data lookup tool using Excel. Like, creating a tableau report, just using data validation and dropdowns and stuff and conditional formatting I guess? Sounds stupid and I've never done something so crazy so yep I failed hard. Also had another interview based around SQL, which I know like the back of my hand. Aced the interview, and almost got an offer, but disqualified last round.

Then I had another interview for BI engineer position, and they were “disappointed” with me for not speaking to what SQL I’d used. The manager was honestly a douche, I could tell just from his demeanor, and how he acted. Dude seemed like he was barely invested in the interview. It was supposed to be a meet and greet, NOT an interview, that’s verbatim what I was told. Then I get told I should’ve explained size of my SQL queries, how many rows, types of joins. Like uh, it’s a meet and greet to learn more about the role, and YOU did not ask ME any of that either?

It’s just so infuriating.... 3 years ago, we had 1-3 interviews for low to mid level jobs. Now its 3-8 interviews minimum plus 2+ case studies, for ANY JOB. Like, imagine working for a company and being praised for years, now because of ""economic conditions"" hundreds get laid off, and treated like children in interviews to rejoin the firm.

Why is there no interest in Business Analytics?,14ivufl,"My job title is Analytics Manager and I work for a large company that has a formal Business Intelligence/Data Science department. In this org, we are split into 3 parts: 1) Data Engineering, 2) Data Science, and 3) Business Analytics

Data Engineering builds the data pipelines, ETLs, and manages the data warehouse. Data Science works on very specific projects like recommender, search, and customer churn models.

Meanwhile Business Analytics is like the business jobs that are also technical. Their job can be dashboarding, executive reporting, strategy insights, market analytics, etc. but they have to know a lot of SQL and some programming in order to extract the data and transform it into insights. They also need to know business context. It’s like 50% coding and 50% making financial models and/or PowerPoint decks for execs.

When we interview people, especially interns and younger candidates, nobody wants to do BA. Everyone wants to do DS. The ironic thing is the DS jobs are the fewest in quantity and they only hire the most qualified people (usually people with PhDs). All the DE people have backgrounds in CS and the BA people have backgrounds like people on this sub where they usually have a MS in DS or Analytics.

It just seems like the BA jobs are off putting to many candidates. As soon as I mention PowerPoint or excel, I can feel their souls die lol. The truth is it’s part of the job, but there’s more to it than that. I code a lot, I grab data from APIs, I go through developer docs, but yes, I also build decks and am good at it. I think there’s more jobs in this sector and more upside for promotions and job opportunities.

Job is a nightmare - Advice,13peb5z,"Hi. I'm 24F. Recently finished my masters in statistics. Interested in data science and miraculously I was hired to do analysis for two large companies under the same parent group. I was super excited but 3 months later. I'm miserable. 

I thought I would've been able to take some data and clean it up and do some cool analysis on it. But it's so much. I can't handle this. I have to keep track of customer and sales data for two large companies. Most of the data isn't even clean. There's about 5 platforms to keep track of for each. There's stupid meetings every day. Presentations for each company every week. And then in-between that I have to find time to do my own work. I have no personal time. My relationship died.

My boss is an absolute nightmare. A stereotypical corporate bro. The most emotionless uncaring blunt workaholic person I've ever met. I can do nothing right in his eyes. I've never received a list of specific tasks to do. Sometimes I give him insights into some data and he ignores it. I don't care for a bunch of emotional shit but a little bit of empathy or something. And then they're telling me about their plans for me long term in the company and they've already sent me on a trip abroad for training.

I just wanted to use some sales/customer data and do some analysis man. This is too much. How do I even navigate this?

Today I had a beautiful moment that I had to share,16h8ovh,"This is going to be somewhat long. I apologize but I have to share. 

Last summer, completely against my will, I was told that I had to manage a high school intern who was in a program to prepare for college. The program was to get hands on experience at a company before they went to school so they could decide a career path with more information on what the day to day is like in the workplace.

When I met this student, he informed me the program randomly placed the kids into jobs blindly. He had no idea what I did or what he was going to do. When I told him I am a data scientist, he was not happy and had no interest at all. He was hoping for a sales or marketing placement as that is more interesting to him.

The first week did not go well at all. He was very disinterested and vocal about it. So at the end of the week we did our required weekly progress report and I just begged him to give it a chance, because if he did poorly, we’re both going to look bad. 

Over the course of the 4 months he was with me, we spent afternoons completing complex problems, learning various programs, and making key business decisions using data driven decision making. I taught him SQL, R, Python, and power bi-automate. The kid was a natural. As a junior in high school he picked everything up faster than any university intern or junior I have ever trained. 

When our time was up. He thanked me for the opportunity and admitted while it was far from a career path he would choose, he learned a lot of valuable lessons and appreciated the experience. I attended his “graduation ceremony” from the program, we said our goodbyes, and parted ways. 


Here is where it gets just crazy. This morning, he sent me a long message on LinkedIn, wondering if I remembered him. And told me how inspiring our time was together. So much so that when he graduated this summer, he decided that he chose his college major (computer science & statistics) because of how gratifying the work we did was and how interested in data he became during our time. 

I’ll admit, I bawled like a baby. I was so honored to receive that message, and it was so gratifying for myself to be able to get through to someone like that.

You all need to think more like a company when working in a company.,16m7re1,"There's been a lot of complaining about stakeholders expectations on data scientists here lately.

This is not a good mindset and it's certainly not a good influence on those here new to the field.

&#x200B;

1. (almost) Every employer is in the business of making money. We are paid well because (presumably) what we do makes that goal happen more. It's that simple. But the work a data scientist does is not valuable if it does not end up either making more money enter the company, or making less money leave the company. If you are working on a project and you can not explain how it will result in one or both of those things happening (indirectly counts), you need to take a step back and figure that out.
2. If sales or leadership is asking you to give them simple explanations, it's not because they need you to explain your degree in three sentences. They are asking you to explain *which actual outcome becomes different when whatever you are building is added*, so that they can *help you sell your work to customers or downstream users,* and for you to indicate *what time and resources you need to make that happen*. Again, if you can not identify the action or decision which ends up different once your solution is in place, and describe how you optimize that outcome, you should be sceptical as to whether it is actually impactful.
3. When you are asked to outline deliverables, they are *letting you explain to them in what way you prefer to deliver your value added*. That is giving you the power. They are not asking you to do more work in a shorter time. They are asking you what will come out of your work, and what steps you (and they) will need to take to make that outcome happen. *Surely* the work you did two weeks ago (last sprint, if you will) is feeding into work you are doing now or at some point down the line. *The way it does so - is the deliverable of the work you did two weeks ago*. Even if that is a documented (positive or negative) outcome of an experiment. I refuse to believe that people with a master's degree or PhD in an engineering- or scientific field are not able to break their work down into steps if they put their mind to it.

Normalize writing good code,150rn3c,"The hardest part of ML is reading code written by other data scientists. Even code written by the highest level ML practitioners is atrocious.

Can we normalize coding good practices in data science?

1. Stop using long functions. Break complex logic into pieces.
2. Stop using massive one-liners to do complex data manipulation
3. Use type annotations and type hinting in function declarations
4. Use docstrings to describe what a function does, its inputs, and return values and types

I need to show how grateful I am to this sub,1b8ym5o,"Thanks you guys fpr every single book recommendation, for every single career advice.

I took your recommendations seriously, studied the books you told me to study, and studied other videos on my own, learning everything I can learn on my own.

Then I took the advice someone here told is to talk to someone internally in the data science team, turns out, they were impressed by the scope of the projects I worked on for a sales analyst and how I improved everything data-related in the department and the lead told me once I am ready (I still have a probability course to finish and recap hands on ML) and I will be up for a transfer.

I will be a junior DS in 5 or 6 months time after being an analyst for 2 years (I started when I was 20) and it's all you guys, so, thanks. 

Edit: here's everything:

I started when I was 18 years old, in something that I never knew it would be my gate to this job: a sales agent. Been so for a whole year. This gave me a lot of business context, how a manager leads people under him, and how his manager looks at his performance and understood something about the hierarchical behavior of companies. 
Then, I left the job after a year, now it's the pandemic, I spent it leqrning Excel and basic statistics, all on YouTube.

Moving forward to when I was 20, I had no idea a data analyst is even a title, and got a job as an accountant at a small workshop, with college going on, and I was studying business administration and statistics.
The job was never an accountant or have anything to do with accounting, my manager at the time was a very smart guy, working with pen and paper as his ledger, then I introduced Excel, he was all in for it, I started creating tables for our sales and inventory and customers and places we work in.

He started asking questions, you said last month we made 40K, how come we make 45 this month? I started digging into our data unknowingly doing analysis.

His brother was a regular visitor, I learned that he is the head of data at a big startup in our country, saw what I did, kept giving me tasks and I answer with Excel.

Then, he gave me a course that I highly recommend about Excel: power tools in Excel, you can find sources on YouTube for it a lot (power query, power pivot and data modeling). I started applying DAX, and here comes my first book [Dax Guide](https://www.google.com.eg/books/edition/_/dtr8oQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQo4eZ8OKEAxUXgP0HHXfgDTIQ7_IDKAB6BAgPEAM).

Then I started my LinkedIn journey, showing Excel and powerBI dashboards and applying to jobs, in data analysis, really that's all you need, business context, some technical tools to help you dig into the data and answer questions.

Then, I started reading about data science, how statistics is important and how much I liked it in college, here goes the second book, [Naked Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data-ebook/dp/B007Q6XLF2).
Here I learned to think with stats a bit.

Then, I found that I lack implementation to a lot of concepts to statistics, people recommended python for me, here there were two sources for me to learn from, YouTube courses got me up and running into how to write simple code in python and understand the syntax.

Later, DataCamp had tracks, I finished the Data Analyst with python and another one data analyst with SQL. This helped me BIG time in knowing where to go next. 

Note: I was doing all of that while working and being in college.

The DataCamp course had great courses about statistics and probability and simulation. While also practicing SQL, I got really good with it.

Now, got a job as a junior sales ops analyst (my role now). I got lucky, working on real problems and practicing what I learn.

Then started moving back to books, but I lacked problem solving mindset, read these books: [Stop Guessing](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Guessing-Behaviors-Problem-Solvers/dp/162656986X) and[Lean Analytics](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

This helped me big time understand how my work affects the company. 

Now it's time to show your work to stakeholders, I read this book: [Storytelling with data](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

It's time to go back to the details of my job, It was all querying on metabase, an open source BI tool.

I was responsible for giving agents retailers to visit, so, Every morning, we are supposed to apply filters on our data (last order date, last visit date and some other features ) and tell the agent, visit 20 of those retailers and go home. I was doing all of that in an automated fashion with power query, creating automated pipelines was my passion in Excel. All I had to do was give it an updated file from our database, refresh the pipeline, take the new file, dump it into our system.

They do visit 20 retailers, but the problem reached the tech team, the data was too much to handle, requiring us to give a smaller set of retailers for the agents, specifically 40 retailers.

But how do we guarantee they are close to each other? Here come my first interaction with adata scientist.

I did all what I did in Excel but in python using pandas and then reached the point where I don't know how to give clusters.

He took my jupyter notebook, gave it to us back with the solution to our problem, with something I was not familiar with at the time, Kmeans constrained.
Which took only longitude, latitude gave each agent his route of 40 retailers.

I started taking notes from his improvements to my code and asked him, what did you do?

He told my my code was fine, but you used a lot of custom functions on operations that can be vectorized, I asked for a book recommendation about vectorized operations in pandas here, the guys recommended this [Data Wrangling in python book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Tools-Easier/dp/1491948817).

After that book, I was obsessed with data automation in python using pandas and numpy only.

I got also obsessed with vectorizing any operation in our code base, read something pandas specific now: [Effective Pandas](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).

Then, it was the part where he interacted with our system API.

Since all our company data scientists and swes have access to snowflake and live databases, we, analysts, had access to only metabase.

I saw this as an opportunity to get known!

I wrote two functions used by our entire company, ret_metabase and interact_with_google_sheets
The first one connects to the API endpoint and then takes your credintials and the makes a session ID and gets your card ID string response in json and I convert it to a dataframe. The second requires an Api key, thenenables tge user to do anything with a google sheet, remove data set with a dataframe get data asa dataframe append on data filter views really anything in one function.
How did I learn to do all of that? A course on youtube , just type API development in python amd a book about data structures, [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM). This helped big time in optimizing my code performance and writing cleaner code.

I got known and these functions are in the companies library now and people use it all the time. And I even left funny comments in the documentation and Everything.

The kmeans thing got me really interested in machine learning and here's the first book you guys recommended: [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/).

It was really hard for me at first because I had not been introduced properly to those three topics:
1- linear algebra
2- calculus
3- probability and statistics
I took [Jon Krohn's live lessions](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations) it's free on YouTube.

But those three were later taken (started linear algebra in November 23).

So I struggled back then and here, another book was suggested: Hands-on ML.

I finished it and was really fucking hyped to apply the stuff I learned directly into my job, even without my manager permissions.

But that was not enough, I did not know what I should do to impact our compqny, what is data science?

I read this book: [Data science with business, what you need to know about DS](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323)

First thing I dod after understanding what kmeans is, improved our routes clustering function by standerdizing the scales of the long, lat, giving it another column ( retailer rank) that rankstarts at the maximum value the longitude and decays linearly from 31 to 30 (longitude here is from 30 to 31), I used linspace and select in numpy here to give retailers ranks. This rank was business objective (give 31 toretailers with high conversion and then 30.9 to retailers with monotonically decreasing nmv to make them order back and so on...) Any other retailer takes a zero in his face. This helped in giving optimized distance to retailers we really need to visit.

This gave us a big boost in agents strike rate and overall performance.

Second, I applied xgboost, predicting who will place an order today if visited. Gave them the biggest rank.

Testing this was a must, so I learned about A/B testing, and some other great bootstrapping ideas here [Practical Statistics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) Book.

This pushed our strike rate from 40 to 73%.

Then, I really now see that I lack probability knowledge and maths knowledge to be a data scientist, so I read [Essential maths for DS](https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098102932).

Since my job was about sales operations, it was a necessary thing to automate discovering new sales areas and opportunity, previously, we used to draw polygons in areas we want to open, and then the agents are set there to wander and find retailers on their own.

I got an idea, how about I get all streets know in this area and make blocks in the intersections and then convert the coords to google maps link and give 50 daily sequential links to agents to discover areas in a more naturally sequential way? I used omnix API to get streets data and geopandas to make all other operations, I learned how to work with geopandas from their docs, really straightforward.

This project was big, applied everything I know about pandas and data structures and business knowledge to do it, and it's up and running now.

I got praised for it and the head of data was impressed with the result and decided to give me access to snowflake directly to limit requests on metabase as the data was big and then I scaled the project to all regions we operate in.

Then it was time to speak with the senior ds lead.

I showed him all I wrote here, he recommended I get a strong foundation in linear algebra and calculus and probability.

I got it, and now working on probability and statistics.

I then told him I am really into causal inference (rwcommended by someone in my previous post here) and regression analysis.

He said that's exactly what they need from the junior they want to hire, ""anyone can fit and predict nowdays"" he said, ""we need someone who can make an impact in all the stuff we don't have time for and teach him more cloud tools and maybe he gives us new ideas or show us new tools"" he elaborated.

Right now I am studying probability and statistics and then will study [Causal Inference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/causal-inference-in/9781098140243/).


I guess that's all, the most important thing is that you keep studying and never giving up, please, focus more on business context as it's overlooked.

PSA: You don't need fancy stuff to do good work.,13cpckb,"I've been reading a lot of posts on r/datascience and several seem to orbit the subject of how to use the latest tool or tweak, I understand that it can be easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of tools, frameworks, and cutting-edge technologies. While these advancements can undoubtedly enhance our work, it's important to remember that data science isn't about using the most advanced or expensive tools; it's about extracting valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.

Data Collection and Categorization

Before diving into advanced machine learning algorithms or statistical models, we need to start with the basics: collecting and organizing data. Fortunately, both Python and R offer a wealth of libraries that make it easy to collect data from a variety of sources, including web scraping, APIs, and reading from files. Key libraries in Python include [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), while R has [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html), [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

These libraries not only make it easy to collect data but also to clean and structure it for analysis. With just a few lines of code, you can filter, sort, and transform data into a format that's ready for exploration and modeling.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Once your data is collected and organized, the next step is to analyze and visualize it. Both Python and R excel in this area, providing a wide range of libraries and packages for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Python's pandas, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) libraries offer powerful functionality for data manipulation, while [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/) provide versatile tools for creating visualizations. Similarly, in R, you can use dplyr, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) for data manipulation, and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html), and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for visualization. These packages enable you to create insightful visualizations and perform statistical analyses without relying on expensive or proprietary software.

Modeling and Prediction

Finally, when it comes to building models and making predictions, Python and R have a plethora of options available. Libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)in Python, or [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/), [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf), and [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)in R, provide powerful machine learning algorithms and statistical models that can be applied to a wide range of problems. What's more, these libraries are open-source and have extensive documentation and community support, making it easy to learn and apply new techniques without needing specialized training or expensive software licenses.

Simplicity is key, embrace it and you'll learn a lot faster than trying to glean insights from some poorly trained AI model.

Burned out after 3 days,14a2u7h,"So I graduated University last month, and have had 3 different data scientist internships, and have just started a full time Data Scientist position at a scale-up company, where I am the second data scientist (the other data scientist is my manager) - and am 3 days into my job. 

I got hired with the company knowing I have zero experience with AWS, and I have no experience or domain knowledge industry of this industry (telecom industry). 

I’ve been tasked for my first project by the founder and the CTO of the company which is to understand how a ‘big and important’ client is losing so much money in Asia. And have been told numerous times how important the success of this project is for my company’s financial future and if the project isn’t successful we would lose this major client - and there is a strict deadline for 1 months time to complete this major project, which includes answering over 20 giant questions about the data, with many deliverables (it doesn’t help the quality of data is absolutely garbage). 

It’s only been 3 days and I feel so out of my depth. The founders and CTO are referring to this project as a ‘trial by fire’ and I am terrified. 

Sure the project is do-able, but I’m a fresh grad, junior data scientist and don’t feel like a project of this scale and importance should be given to a junior. Or maybe it should and I’m going crazy. 

My manager is great but has little time to support me. 

Not sure what to do or feel, but terrified and burnt out already by the thought of failing this project, losing the company tons of money and maybe getting fired as I’m on probation for the first 6 months of my job.

Data Science is a fad (Cynical Post #2334),14khdp2,"I wanted to contribute yet another post which is more on the cynical side regarding data science as an industry. I know that many people lurking here are trying to draw up pros and cons lists for going into the industry. This is a contribution to the cons column.

My current gripe with DS is that I have lost faith that the industry will ever be able to absorb data-driven decision making as a culture. For a long time, I thought that it's more about improving my communication skills, creating explainers on how the models work, or just waiting for the world to 'catch-up' to data science. These techniques were new and complex, after all - it would take some time for the industry to adjust, as a Gartner article might tell you. But those businesses which did adjust would do better over time, and the market would force others to compete.

This line of thinking completely falls apart once you go into the history of 'quantitative methods' in business decision making. DS is really just the latest in a long line of attempts at doing this stuff including:

* Quantitative Methods
* Operations Research
* Management Science (Rebranded Operations Research)
* Business Intelligence
* Data Mining
* Business Analytics

All these fields are still around, of course. But they tend to occupy a particular niche, and their claims to radically transform the business world are gone. They aren't the 'sexiest job of the 21 century"". People have been trying to do this whole ""Business, but with Models!"" thing for *years*. But it never really caught on. Why?

DS is just hype, and the hype cycle for DS will implode and not recover. Or it will recover to the same level that these other techniques did.

Data Science isn't better than any of those other disciplines. Here is my response to some objections:

* **Maybe they weren't adding real business value?** Crack open the average Operations Research / Management Science textbook and I guarantee you you'll find problems which are more business-focused than anything you'll find on Towards Data Science or a DS textbook. They developed remarkable models to deal with inventory problems, demand estimation, resource planning, scheduling problems, forecasting and insights gathering - and most of their models were even prescriptive and automated using Optimization solvers.
* **But they weren't putting their models in production right?** Yes, but the concept of doing a regression on a huge business data base, or even using a decision tree, is decades old now. It used to be called ""Knowledge Discovery in Databases"" and later ""Data Mining"". The ISLR of data mining, Witten's *Data Mining*, was first published in 2003. That's 20 years ago. They were using Java to do everything we do today, and at a reasonable scale (especially considering that with many of these problems, an extra GB of data doesn't get you much).
* **But they weren't doing predictive modelling.** TBH predictive modelling is one of the least impressive sub-branches of modelling, I have no idea why it's so hyped. Much more interesting and relevant models - optimization modelling, risk analysis, forecasting, clustering - have all fallen out of popularity. Why do you think predictive modelling is the secret bullet? Besides, they did have some predictive modelling - 'data mining' used to include it as a part of the study, together with other 'modern' techniques like anomaly detection, association rules/market basket analysis.
* **But what about \[insert specific application here\]**. Most of the things that people pitch as being 'things we can now do with data science' are decades old. For example, customer segmentation models using 'data science' to help you better understand customers... You can find marketing analytics textbooks from the late 90s that show you exactly how to do that. And they'll include a hell of a lot more domain knowledge than most data science articles today, which seem to think that the domain knowledge just needs an introductory paragraph to grok and then we get to the Python.
* **Maybe it just takes time?** Wayne Winston's *Operations Research* was published in 1987 and included material that could help you basically automate a significant amount of your business decision making with a PC. That was 36 years ago.
* **But what about big data?** The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem still apply. At a certain point, the extra gigabyte of data isn't really helping, and neither is the extra column in the database.
* **Data Science is much more complex and advanced, true data science requires a PhD**. An actual graduate level course in Operations Research requires you to integrate advanced linear algebra, computational algorithms and PhD level statistics to develop automated solutions that scale. People with these skills have been building enormous models for the airline industry for a few decades now, but were barely recognized for it. DS isn't that much more complex, so what justifies the large salaries and hype when com. sci + math + stats at scale has been around for a while now?

The marginal improvement in the performance of a subset of statistical techniques (predictive modelling, forecasting) doesn't justify the sudden exuberance about DS and 'data'.

As best I can tell, here is what is truly new in 'data science':

* ML means we can turn unstructured data like videos and images and text into structured data: e.g. easily estimating the amount of damage by a flood for an insurer using satellite images.
* People in Silicon Valley can have human-out-the-loop decision making, which they need for their apps and recommenders. This use case is truly new and didn't exist in the 90s.

I think that this kind of 'operational data science' makes sense: using truly new types of data from video to images, and having computers which we can trust to label the data and apply further logic to it. That's new.

But the kind of data science where you think that you submitting a report or visualisation to your boss and then he'll take it into consideration when he makes decisions - that's been around for ages. It's never become the kind of revolutionary, widespread force in business that DS keeps promising it will be. In ten years, ""data scientist"" will be like Operations Researcher - a very niche and special thing off in the corner somewhere which most people don't know about outside of a particular industry.

The only people who managed to really turn maths into money were the Actuarial Scientists and the Quants (Financial Engineers).

My take now is basically this:

* If you work in the actual niche where data science has something new to offer - processing unstructured data for use in live apps like Tinder - then yes, continue. That's great. That's the equivalent of doing Operations Research and going into logistics.
* If you are trying to apply those same techniques to general business decision making, then you are going to end up like a ""Management Scientist"" or, for that matter, a ""BI Analyst"" in a few years - they were once the cutting edge just like DS is now. They amounted to very little. There's really no difference. Predictive modelling is not so much more amazing than optimization or association rules, which nobody talks about much anymore.
* If you just want to make a lot of money doing maths - go for Actuarial Science or Financial Engineering/Quants. Those guys figured it out and then created a walled garden of credentials to protect their salaries. Just join them. (Although I hear Act Sci is more about regulations in practise than maths, but still).

tl;dr - DS is just the latest in a long string of equally 'revolutionary' and impressive attempts at introducing scientific decision making into business. It will become as marginalised as all of them in the future, outside of the Silicon Valley niche. Your boss, your company and your industry will never adopt a true data-driven culture - they've had almost 40 years to do it by now and they're still suspicious of regression beyond the 'line of best fit'.

Pre screening assessments are getting insane,191zdny,"I am a data scientist in industry. I applied for a job of data scientist. 

I heard back regarding an assessment which is a word document from an executive assistant. The task is to automate anaysis for bullet masking cartilages. They ask to build an algorithm and share the package to them.

No data was provided, just 1 image as an example with little  explanation . They expect a full on model/solution to be developed in 2 weeks. 

Since when is this bullshit real, how is a data scientist expected to get the bullet cartilages of a 9mm handgun with processing and build an algorithm and deploy it in a package in the span of two weeks for a Job PRE-SCREENING.

Never in my life saw any pre screening this tough. This is a flat out project to do on the job.


Edit: i saw a lot of the comments from the people in the community. Thank you so much for sharing your stories. I am glad that I am not the only one that feels this way. 

Update: the company expects candidates to find google images for them mind it, do the forensic analysis and then train a model for them. Everything is to be handed to them as a package. Its even more grunt work where people basically collect data for them and build models. 

Update2: the hiring manager responds with saying this is a very basic straightforward task. Thats what the job does on a daily basis and is one of the easiest things a data scientist can do. Despite the overwhelming complexity and how tedious it is to manually do the thing.

How do you feel about unionizing efforts in tech?,13ep6bl,"I'm a new grad, I'm finishing up my first internship, but the massive layoffs in tech have me worried for the future. As well as all the advancements in AI, like the PaLM 2 announcement at Google I/O 2023, that can take over more DA/DS jobs in the future. I'm worried about a world where companies feel free to layoff even more tech workers so they can contract a handful of analysts to just adjust AI written code.

I've been following along the Writer's Guild strike in Hollywood, seeing how well-organized they are, and how they're addressing the use of AI to take their roles, among other concerns. But I'm not familiar with any well-organized tech unions that might be offering people the same protections. I just kinda wanna know people's thoughts on unions in this industry, if there are any strong efforts to organize and protect ourselves here in the future, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/13ep6bl/how_do_you_feel_about_unionizing_efforts_in_tech/,sommeilhotel,319,Discussion,263,Top - year
I made it....!!!! 🍻,1alzjgv,"Hi guys!

I got confirmed to be onboarded as a Data Scientist to a major conglomerate. I have been trying hard to move to a product company after years in consulting. I have been a once-in-a-blue-moon poster and mostly a lurker here. But the advice from various comments and posts has been great!

Thanks a ton everyone!! (especially who helped me out with my SQL [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/192abuy/out_of_job_how_to_keep_up_sql_practise/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

&#x200B;

**My background** \-

I am based out of India and I started my career as an SAP Consultant. 5 years into it, I pivoted to Data science, joined a consulting start-up and now finally moved to data scientist role after trying for a year and half. I know it's quite hard to get into the field right now, so I am willing to help out anyone who wanna talk.

I am reachable on Discord (*jaegarbong*) and DMs.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**:

Thanks for the love guys. I am trying to reply as fast as I can to the DMs. But since I found a few FAQs,  I will list them out here.

1. I got my job in India and not in USA/Europe.
2. I have not done any masters.
3. There are lots of moving parts to getting a job. Since I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, I can't provide any new tips/tricks that you probably haven't seen reels/videos/articles of.
4. Scoring an interview has a different skillset from cracking the interview. The former is mostly non-technical, the latter being extremely technical.
5. If you have anything specific area I can assist with, I am more than happy to help if I can.
6. Again, I must request you to not ask me for guidance without being specific - I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, so me repeating the same advice won't work. For e.g. a specific question might be  - ""*Is DSA necessary to learn*?"" Then no, I have neither studied DSA nor have been asked in any of my 30+ interviews I have given. However, it's not a thumb rule that you might not be asked.

Please understand that I am not being rude here, but rather trying to not repeat the same vanilla tips/tricks/guidance that you probably have not come across already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1alzjgv/i_made_it/,jaegarbong,300,Career Discussion,91,Top - year
Where are all the entry level jobs? Which MS program should I go for? Some tips from a hiring manager at an F50,17avmi5,"The bulk of this subreddit is filled with people trying to break into data science, completing certifications and getting MS degrees from diploma mills but with no real guidance. Oftentimes the advice I see here is from people without DS jobs trying to help other people without DS jobs on projects etc. It's more or less blind leading the blind.

Here's an insider perspective from me. I'm a hiring manager at an F50 financial services company you've probably heard of, I've been working for \~4 years and I'll share how entry-level roles actually get hired into.

There's a few different pathways. I've listed them in order of where the bulk of our candidate pool and current hires comes from

1. We pick MS students from very specific programs that we trust. These programs have been around for a while, we have a relationship with the school and have a good idea of the curriculum. Georgia Tech, Columbia, UVa, UC Berkeley, UW Seattle, NCSU are some universities we hire from. We don't come back every year to hire, just the years that we need positions filled. Sometimes you'll look around at teams here and 40% of them went to the same program. They're stellar hires. The programs that we hire from are incredibly competitive to get into, are not diploma mills, and most importantly, their programs have been around longer than the DS hype. How does the hiring process work? We just reach out to the career counselor at the school, they put out an interest list for students who want to work for us, we flip through the resumes and pick the students we like to interview. It's very streamlined both for us as an employer and for the student. Although I didn't come from this path (I was a referred by a friend during the hiring boom and just have a PhD), I'm actively involved in the hiring efforts.
2. We host hackathons every year for students to participate in. The winners of these hackathons typically get brought back to interview for internship positions, and if they perform well we pick them up as full time hires.
3. Generic career fairs at universities. If you go a to a university, you've probably seen career fairs with companies that come to recruit.
4. Referrals from our current employees. Typically they refer a candidate to us, we interview them, and if we like them, we'll punt them over to the recruiter to get the process started for hiring them. Typically the hiring manager has seen the resume before the recruiter has because the resume came straight to their inbox from one of their colleagues
5. Internal mobility of someone who shows promise but just needs an opportunity. We've already worked with them in some capacity, know them to be bright, and are willing to give them a shot even if they don't have the skills.
6. Far and away the worst and hardest way to get a job, our recruiter sends us their resume after screening candidates who applied online through the job portal. Our recruiters know more or less what to look for (I'm thankful ours are not trash)

This is true not just for our company but a lot of large companies broadly. I know Home Depot, Microsoft and few other large retail companies some of my network works at hire candidates this way.

Is it fair to the general population? No. But as employees at a company we have limited resources to put into finding quality candidates and we typically use pathways that we know work, and work well in generating high quality hires.

EDIT: Some actionable advice for those who are feeling disheartened. I'll add just a couple of points here:

1. If you already have your MS in this field or a related one and are looking for a job, reach out to your network. Go to the career fairs at your university and see if you can get some data-adjacent job in finance, marketing, operations or sales where you might be working with data scientists. Then you can try to transition internally into the roles that might be interesting to you.
2. There are also non-profit data organizations like Data Kind and others. They have working data scientists already volunteering time there, you can get involved, get some real world experience with non-profit data sets and leverage that to set yourself apart. It's a fantastic way to get some experience AND build your professional network.
3. Work on an open-source library and making it better. You'll learn some best practices. If you make it through the online hiring screen, this will really set you apart from other candidates
4. If you are pre MS and just figuring out where you want to go, research the program's career outcomes before picking a school. No school can guarantee you a job, but many have strong alumni and industry networks that make finding a job way easier. Do not go just because it looks like it's easy to get into. If it's easy to get into, it means that they're a new program who came in with the hype train

EDIT 2: I think some people are getting the wrong idea about ""prestige"" where the companies I'm aware of only hire from Ivies or public universities that are as strong as Ivies. That's not always the case - some schools have deliberately cultivated relationships with employers to generate a talent pipeline for their students. They're not always a top 10 school, but programs with very strong industry connections.

For example, Penn State is an example of a school with very strong industry ties to companies in NJ, PA and NY for engineering students. These students can go to job fairs or sign up for company interest lists for their degree program at their schools, talk directly to working alumni and recruiters and get their resume in front of a hiring manager that way. It's about the relationship that the university has cultivated to the local industries that hire and their ability to generate candidates that can feed that talent pipeline.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17avmi5/where_are_all_the_entry_level_jobs_which_ms/,Consistent-Design-57,307,Discussion,149,Top - year

I feel like a fraud,14fgpm7,"Hello,

I'm a so-called data scientist with 4 YoE and an academic background in maths (pretty much nothing in software engineering).

My first job out of college was in a small ""data team"" (I was the only DS, there were 2 others guys, mostly seniors and sort of a mix of Data Engineer/Devops/Software Engineer). Our team mission was to bring value to the company using data.

Job was pretty chill, tbh I haven't been doing much over the 4 years. Mostly failed POC on jupyter and a lot of non-DS-related stuff (like dashboarding type of stuff).

However, there was one initiative I took that resulted in something that was deemed valuable enough to be pushed into production. It was a mix of NLP/timeseries project which actually gave some very interesting results, although if I'm being honest, it is definitely not worth the 4 years of salary they paid me.

As I was asked to industrialize the solution, I had some help from my other 2 senior colleagues who introduced me to linux, git, docker/kubernetes, flask, airflow, and some good coding practices such as linting, testing, hinting, logging, classes and decorators on Python.

The thing is, they never reviewed my work nor made sure I was following all the recommended guidelines, and as I was overwhelmed by all those new concepts, I ended up just not following them, or not correctly at least.

Like sure, I'll use git to track my code. Guess what, I never work with branching and just commited everything on the same master branch.

Classes and decorators ? No that's too complex and abstract, let's just do it plain and simple.

Testing and hinting ? Maybe later.

Couple of times I have tried to motivate myself to learn all of this properly on my own, but although I have learned some stuff this and there, I have never reached that stage where I feel comfortable using all this, and always felt unmotivated afterwards by how vast those subjects are and how little I knew.

&#x200B;

3 months ago, my manager who used to be a technical guy but has been doing managing for quite some time now, and who for some reason always thought I was someone brilliant and creative out of the bunch (he led 3 other teams with a total of \~20 people) was hired by a mid-size company to become their head of data. He offered me a position here as a senior data scientist which I took. He then hired a couple of other data scientists (they introduced themselves as MLE rather than DS) with about 2 YoE.

Those guys are so good they are making me feel like a fraud. They are using git as if they invented the tool. The way they structured their code, using mostly classes and decorators everywhere just baffles me. They seem to have no trouble with devops concept (like CI/CD), API management, networks etc ... while I'm here struggling with the proxy of my VM just to reach the internet.

I've recently discovered the joy of reviewing PR on github and boy it is exhausting to follow what they do. I basically have to google everything as they are using stuff I didn't even knew existed. It probably took me 10 hours to review a bunch of code they wrote in probably one hour.

I am sure by now they see me as a fraud, and they seem to be both the kind of judging type (3 weeks in and they already had some heated arguments on software engineering). I think so far I was protected by my ""senior"" title and the fact that I have known our manager for quite some time now, but I'm expecting that this masquerade will not hold for long.

&#x200B;

I'm lost, IDK what to do. Is there a way for me to catch up everything in a short amount of time ? I understand that a regular data scientist with ""expertise"" in ML is no longer bankable and people now are turning towards ""full-stack"" MLE with a software engineering background, who are able to manage the entire pipeline and  produce professional code that is robust, readable and maintanable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14fgpm7/i_feel_like_a_fraud/,Simple-Airport8868,305,Meta,82,Top - year

RANT - There's a cheating problem in Data Science Interviews,15flo97,"I work at a large company, and we receive quite a lot of applicants. Most of our applicants have 6-9 years of experience in roles titled as Data Analytics/Data Science/Data Engineering across notable companies and brands like Walmart, Ford, Accenture, Amazon, Ulta, Macy's, Nike, etc.

The nature of our interviews is fairly simple - we have a brief phone call on theory and foundation of data analytics, and then have a couple of technical interviews focusing on programming and basic data analysis. The interview doesn't cover anything out of the ordinary for most analysts (not even data scientists), and focuses on basic data analysis practices (filter down a column given a set of requirements, get a count of uniques, do basic EDA and explain how to manage outliers). 

All interviewees are told they can use Google as we don't expect people to memorize the syntax, but we do expect them to have at least working knowledge of the tools we expect them to use. The interviews are all remote and don't require in-person meeting. The interviews are basically screen share of Google Colab where we run basic analysis.

In our recent hiring spree, out of the 7 potential candidates we interviewed, we caught 4 of them cheating.

Given their profile, I'm a bit amazed that they resorted to cheating. Whether it was by having someone else on the call helping them answer the question, or having someone entirely different answer their questions, and other notable methods that I don't want to share that we caught while they were sharing their screens. I've learned from my colleagues that there are actual *agencies* in India and China who offer interview 'assistance' services.

At this stage, our leadership is planning to require all potential candidates to be local - this eliminates remote option. On the same token, those cheaters passing the recruiter screening are quite frankly just making it worse for people who are actually capable. Questions become more theoretical and quite specific to industry, scope of hiring will be limited to people within specific domains, and improptu coding tests will be given out without heads up to hinder people from cheating and setting up whatever they do to cheat.

How do you convince the management that they don't need ML when a simple IF-ELSE logic would work?,15vbkkn,"So my org has hired a couple of data scientists recently. We've been inviting them regularly to our project meetings. It has been only a couple of weeks into the meetings and they have already started proposing ideas to the management about how the team should be using ML, DL and even LLMs. 

The management, clearly influenced by these fanc & fad terms, is now looking down upon my team for not having thought about these ideas before, and wants us to redesign a simple IF-ELSE business logic using ML.

It seems futile to workout an RoI calculation for this new initiative and present it to the management when they are hell-bent on having that sweet  AI tag in their list of accomplishments. Doing so would also show my team in bad light for resisting change and not being collaborative enough with the new guys.

But it is interesting how some new-age data scientists prematurely propose solutions, without even understanding the business problem and the tradeoffs. It is not the first time I am seeing this perennial itch to disrupt among newer professionals, even outside of data science. I've seen some very naive explanations given by these new data scientists, such as, ""Oh, its a standard algorithm. It just needs more data. It will get better over time."" Well, it does not get better. And it is my team that needs to do the clean up after all this POC mess. Why can't they spend time understanding what the business requirements are and if you really need to bring the big guns to a stick fight?

I'm not saying there aren't any ML problems that need solving in my org, but this one is not a problem that needs ML. It is just not worth the effort and resources. My current data science team is quite mature in business understanding and dissecting the problem to its bone before coming up with an analytical solution, either ML or otherwise; but now it is under pressure to spit out predictive models whose outputs are as good as flukes in production, only because management wants to ride the AI ML bandwagon.

Edit: They do not directly report to me, the VP level has interviewed them and hired them under their tutelage to make them data-smart. And since they give proposals to the VPs and SVPs directly, it is often they jumping down our throats to experiment and execute.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15vbkkn/how_do_you_convince_the_management_that_they_dont/,OverratedDataScience,295,Discussion,160,Top - year
"UPDATE #2: I built an app to make my job search a little more sane, and I thought others might like it too! No ads, no recruiter spam, etc.",1ad5lxa,"Hey again everyone!

&#x200B;

We've made a lot of progress on [zen](https://zensearch.jobs/) in the past few months, so I'll drop a couple of the most important things / highlights about the app here:

* Zen is still a candidate / seeker-first job board. This means we have no ads, we have no promoted jobs from companies who are paying us, we have no recruiters, etc. The whole point of Zen is to help you find jobs quickly at companies you're interested in without any headaches.
* On that point, we'll send you emails notifying you when companies you care about post new jobs that match your preferences, so you don't need to continuously check their job boards.

&#x200B;

In the past few months, we've made some major changes! Many of them are [discussed in the changelog](https://zensearch.jobs/changelog):

1. [We now have a much more feature-complete way of matching you to relevant jobs](https://zensearch.jobs/jobs)
2. We've collected a ton of new jobs and companies, so we now have \~2,700 companies in our database and almost 100k open jobs!
3. We've overhauled the UX to make it less noisy and easier for you to find jobs you care about.
4. We also added [a feedback page](https://zensearch.jobs/feedback) to let you submit feedback about the app to us!

&#x200B;

I started building Zen when I was on the job hunt and realized it was harder than it should've been to just get notifications when a company I was interested in posted a job that was relevant to me. And we hope that this goal -- to cut out all the noise and make it easier for you to find great matches -- is valuable for everyone here :)

I have not seen more than 2-3 people leave in last 5-6 years I have been here. I am not planning a move anytime soon since I love the work and overall culture. However, I need a productive way to deal with situation.

Some other clarification - we are not being asked to train ""data analyst"" I would rather prefer that. We are being asked to train people who don't code and use an automated software to pick and dump data.

Old manager (data scientist) left and now a manager from data management is managing our team. He doesn't understand the project process or requirements. He trying to change a lot of things and one thing he is consistently focusing on is our salaries. He has repeatedly made comments that ""this"" (data science and analytics) team is paid more than other teams and he doesn't see why that's the case. In one one-on-one meeting he mentioned that there are many people on a certain level and company would not be able to support promoting everyone at these salaries hence we need to think about how to replace them once these people quit due to no promotions. We haven't had much luck while trying to hire external people (lack of good candidates). He insisted that we need to hire and train juniors from his team on data science process so that they can catch up and deliver when the time comes. His older team (data management) team works on selecting and filtering data, they have no experience or business understanding of the process. I resisted and mentioned that it's hard enough to find someone with basic knowledge and up-skill them to level they can deliver projects. It would be a very long and frustrating process to train people who have no background in statistics. Also, it would easily take 1-2 years before they can independently take charge to execute things and we should hire at a position if the person doesn't at-least has some basic knowledge or some hands on projects. I also proposed bootcamps/professional trainings. But he was insisting on personal training from current employees.

How to deal with this? He is expecting us to train people one on one so they can potentially replace us?

"Company have no data so 80% of my role is creating synthetic data and its getting repetitive and plain waste of time, what to do?",147l18l,"So as I said for now our company don't have data at all and they want to test models for ai to be used once we get data in the future. I tried to tell them many times we have to get data from soon-to-be customers because our tests are just approximation with synthetic data and aren't reliable. Unfortunately no one is getting some and for now all I do is creating new datasets (synthetic ofc) by guessing what our customers data will look like and use them for experiments that are a waste of time because once again they do not reflect real life results but the synthetic results. For now even all experiments are just the same experiment on new dataset because they want to see changes in results and comparision. I have a pretty good feeling that once we get the real life data we will understand everything was a waste of time but management wants me to keep pursuing this approach.

After all I'm getting paid and the work enviornment in general is amazing but I just feel I'm wasting time and will probably do so in the near future.

Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak,1bln0ix,"Use the Display API to replace complex Matplotlib code 

[ Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak. ](https://preview.redd.it/pimy1i38a1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31492e48a5d39171c60d8e96ee8698c670327e7)

# Introduction

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 A good chart can show us what a model is doing in an easy-to-understand way. Here's an example: 

[ Decision boundaries of two different generalization performances. ](https://preview.redd.it/3rrwu8rfa1qc1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=9425bbe57deb98a854a40fdc0979149637078047)

 This graph makes it clear that for the same dataset, the model on the right is better at generalizing. 

 Most machine learning books prefer to use raw Matplotlib code for visualization, which leads to issues: 

1. You have to learn a lot about drawing with Matplotlib.
2. Plotting code fills up your notebook, making it hard to read.
3. Sometimes you need third-party libraries, which isn't ideal in business settings.

 Good news! Scikit-learn now offers Display classes that let us use methods like from\_estimator and from\_predictions to make drawing graphs for different situations much easier. 

 Curious? Let me show you these cool APIs. 

 

# Scikit-learn Display API Introduction

### Use utils.discovery.all_displays to find available APIs

 Scikit-learn (sklearn) always adds Display APIs in new releases, so it's key to know what's available in your version. 

 Sklearn's [utils.discovery.all\_displays](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays) lets you see which classes you can use. 

    from sklearn.utils.discovery import all_displays
    
    displays = all_displays()
    displays

 For example, in my Scikit-learn 1.4.0, these classes are available: 

    [('CalibrationDisplay', sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay),
     ('ConfusionMatrixDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.confusion_matrix.ConfusionMatrixDisplay),
     ('DecisionBoundaryDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.decision_boundary.DecisionBoundaryDisplay),
     ('DetCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.det_curve.DetCurveDisplay),
     ('LearningCurveDisplay', sklearn.model_selection._plot.LearningCurveDisplay),
     ('PartialDependenceDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.partial_dependence.PartialDependenceDisplay),
     ('PrecisionRecallDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.precision_recall_curve.PrecisionRecallDisplay),
     ('PredictionErrorDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.regression.PredictionErrorDisplay),
     ('RocCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.roc_curve.RocCurveDisplay),
     ('ValidationCurveDisplay',
      sklearn.model_selection._plot.ValidationCurveDisplay)]

### Using inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay for decision boundaries

 Since we mentioned it, let's start with decision boundaries. 

 If you use Matplotlib to draw them, it's a hassle: 

* Use np.linspace to set coordinate ranges;
* Use plt.meshgrid to calculate the grid;
* Use plt.contourf to draw the decision boundary fill;
* Then use plt.scatter to plot data points.

 Now, with  [inspection.DecisionBoundaryDispla](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-inspection-decisionboundarydisplay), you can simplify this process: 

    from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
    X = iris.data[['petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']]
    y = iris.target
    
    
    svc_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                            SVC(kernel='linear', C=1))
    svc_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    display = DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(svc_clf, X, 
                                                     grid_resolution=1000,
                                                     xlabel=""Petal length (cm)"",
                                                     ylabel=""Petal width (cm)"")
    plt.scatter(X.iloc[:, 0], X.iloc[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='w')
    plt.title(""Decision Boundary"")
    plt.show()

 See the final effect in the figure: 

[ Use DecisionBoundaryDisplay to draw a triple classification model. ](https://preview.redd.it/501h2r27b1qc1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3614719f48e74c6aabd0d0754c6b08b80f87d02)

 Remember, Display can only draw 2D, so make sure your data has only two features or reduced dimensions. 

### Using calibration.CalibrationDisplay for probability calibration

 To compare classification models, probability calibration curves show how confident models are in their predictions. 

 Note that  [CalibrationDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay) uses the model's  predict\_proba. If you use a support vector machine, set probability to True: 

    from sklearn.calibration import CalibrationDisplay
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000,
                               n_classes=2, n_features=5,
                               random_state=42)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    proba_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                              SVC(kernel=""rbf"", gamma=""auto"", 
                                  C=10, probability=True))
    proba_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(proba_clf, 
                                                X_test, y_test)
    
    hist_clf = HistGradientBoostingClassifier()
    hist_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    ax = plt.gca()
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(hist_clf,
                                      X_test, y_test,
                                      ax=ax)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn by CalibrationDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/ovcp8hcgb1qc1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=93515b81145abbb70424dcc69bf0cf8569ac4e3a)

### Using metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay for confusion matrices

 When assessing classification models and dealing with imbalanced data, we look at precision and recall. 

 These break down into TP, FP, TN, and FN – a confusion matrix. 

 To draw one, use  [metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-confusionmatrixdisplay). It's well-known, so I'll skip the details. 

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
    
    digits = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)
    X, y = digits.data, digits.target
    rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    rf_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(rf_clf, X, y)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn with ConfusionMatrixDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/tfbcdin8f1qc1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1eaaf8e085e1cff8bb9c4bd971dade508010390)

### metrics.RocCurveDisplay and metrics.DetCurveDisplay

 These two are together because they're often used to evaluate side by side. 

 [RocCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay) compares TPR and FPR for the model. 

 For binary classification, you want low FPR and high TPR, so the upper left corner is best. The Roc curve bends towards this corner. 

 Because the Roc curve stays near the upper left, leaving the lower right empty, it's hard to see model differences. 

 So, we also use [DetCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay) to draw a Det curve with FNR and FPR. It uses more space, making it clearer than the Roc curve. 

 The perfect point for a Det curve is the lower left corner. 

    from sklearn.metrics import RocCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.metrics import DetCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10_000, n_features=5,
                               n_classes=2, n_informative=2)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42,
                                                        stratify=y)
    
    
    classifiers = {
        ""SVC"": make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC(kernel=""linear"", C=0.1, random_state=42)),
        ""Random Forest"": RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    }
    
    fig, [ax_roc, ax_det] = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    for name, clf in classifiers.items():
        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_roc, name=name)
        DetCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_det, name=name)

[ Comparison Chart of RocCurveDisplay and DetCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/odavl54yh1qc1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=6408e319b099ce12c3eff70e788ed0224558e099)

### Using metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay to adjust thresholds

 With imbalanced data, you might want to shift recall and precision. 

* For email fraud, you want high precision.
* For disease screening, you want high recall to catch more cases.

 You can adjust the threshold, but what's the right amount? 

 Here, [metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-precisionrecalldisplay) can help. 

    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
    from sklearn.metrics import PrecisionRecallDisplay
    
    wine = load_wine()
    X, y = wine.data[wine.target<=1], wine.target[wine.target<=1]
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
                                                        stratify=y, random_state=42)
    
    xgb_clf = XGBClassifier()
    xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_estimator(xgb_clf, X_test, y_test)
    plt.show()

[ Charting xgboost model evaluation using PrecisionRecallDisplay.  ](https://preview.redd.it/8giy5tr8i1qc1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b96373c182f515a655d6f4029f44982c87b05d)

 This shows that models following Scikit-learn's design can be drawn, like xgboost here. Handy, right? 

### Using metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay for regression models

 We've talked about classification, now let's talk about regression. 

 Scikit-learn's [metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-predictionerrordisplay) helps assess regression models. 

    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    from sklearn.metrics import PredictionErrorDisplay
    
    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
    X = rng.random(size=(200, 2)) * 10
    y = X[:, 0]**2 + 5 * X[:, 1] + 10 + rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.1, size=(200,))
    
    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='linear', C=10))
    reg.fit(X, y)
    
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[0], kind=""actual_vs_predicted"")
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[1], kind=""residual_vs_predicted"")
    plt.show()

[Two charts were drawn by PredictionErrorDisplay.](https://preview.redd.it/9uxuobuti1qc1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db276b2a7d637cf53887e4cebe87b9a23593b9b)

 As shown, it can draw two kinds of graphs. The left shows predicted vs. actual values – good for linear regression. 

 However, not all data is perfectly linear. For that, use the right graph. 

 It compares real vs. predicted differences, a residuals plot. 

 This plot's banana shape suggests our data might not fit linear regression. 

 Switching from a linear to an rbf kernel can help. 

    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='rbf', C=10))

[ A visual demonstration of the improved model performance.  ](https://preview.redd.it/fsu1yqg0j1qc1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=860447d0c8a1c0c38539f5fac16998ed928c8714)

 See, with rbf, the residual plot looks better. 

### Using model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay for learning curves

 After assessing performance, let's look at optimization with [LearningCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay).

  First up, learning curves – how well the model generalizes with different training and testing data, and if it suffers from variance or bias. 

 As shown below, we compare a DecisionTreeClassifier and a GradientBoostingClassifier to see how they do as training data changes. 

    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import LearningCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, n_features=10,
                               n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0)
    
    tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
    gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=3, tol=1e-3)
    
    train_sizes = np.linspace(0.4, 1.0, 10)
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(tree_clf, X, y,
                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,
                                        ax=axes[0],
                                        scoring='accuracy')
    axes[0].set_title('DecisionTreeClassifier')
    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(gb_clf, X, y,
                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,
                                        ax=axes[1],
                                        scoring='accuracy')
    axes[1].set_title('GradientBoostingClassifier')
    plt.show()

[ Comparison of the learning curve of two different models. ](https://preview.redd.it/2ljyfl9aj1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d7af8bd8a4295c54f6f5c3ce41caf2fd2ddb0c1)

 The graph shows that although the tree-based GradientBoostingClassifier maintains good accuracy on the training data, its generalization capability on test data does not have a significant advantage over the DecisionTreeClassifier. 

### Using model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay for visualizing parameter tuning

 So, for models that don't generalize well, you might try adjusting the model's regularization parameters to tweak its performance. 

 The traditional approach is to use tools like GridSearchCV or Optuna to tune the model, but these methods only give you the overall best-performing model and the tuning process is not very intuitive. 

 For scenarios where you want to adjust a specific parameter to test its effect on the model, I recommend using [model\_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay) to visualize how the model performs as the parameter changes. 

    from sklearn.model_selection import ValidationCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    
    param_name, param_range = ""C"", np.logspace(-8, 3, 10)
    lr_clf = LogisticRegression()
    
    ValidationCurveDisplay.from_estimator(lr_clf, X, y,
                                          param_name=param_name,
                                          param_range=param_range,
                                          scoring='f1_weighted',
                                          cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
    plt.show()

[ Fine-tuning of model parameters plotted with ValidationCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/5dcgo35jj1qc1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3d587e59d31902951ba0c9869ccd2bc39476d4)

# Some regrets

 After trying out all these Displays, I must admit some regrets: 

 

* The biggest one is that most of these APIs lack detailed tutorials, which is probably why they're not well-known compared to Scikit-learn's thorough documentation.
* These APIs are scattered across various packages, making it hard to reference them from a single place.
* The code is still pretty basic. You often need to pair it with Matplotlib's APIs to get the job done. A typical example is DecisionBoundaryDisplay  
, where after plotting the decision boundary, you still need Matplotlib to plot the data distribution.
* They're hard to extend. Besides a few methods validating parameters, it's tough to simplify my model visualization process with tools or methods; I end up rewriting a lot.

 I hope these APIs get more attention, and as versions upgrade, visualization APIs become even easier to use. 

 

# Conclusion

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 This article introduced various plotting APIs in the current version of scikit-learn. 

 With these APIs, you can simplify some Matplotlib code, ease your learning curve, and streamline your model evaluation process. 

 Due to length, I didn't expand on each API. If interested, you can check the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/visualizations.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) for more details.

I'm wondering if I'm missing out anything in life if I have no interest in generative AI applications. How many companies (say out of 100) actually use generative models in their business or work?

How do you remember everything (theory/code) as a data scientist?,146ofs6,"I’m currently working as a Data Analyst/Scientist. It’s my first proper job since I completed my undergrad, and then PhD in Physics. 

I have a solid grasp of advanced mathematics, but I’ve never had any “formal” statistics training. I’m also a competent programmer, but I’m certainly not at the computer science or software developer level. I can write R or Python code which gets the job done but it isn’t always pretty, and will often google for solutions. Because of this, I’m sort of having to pick up things as I go along, which is okay but seems a bit overwhelming at times. 

I’m completely comfortable with exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics etc. However, in my role, I often spend a few weeks at a time working on different projects. Sometimes I’ll work with inferential stats (e.g. using chi squared), and permutation testing. Then I’ll be doing predictive modelling and use something like logistic regression. 

Each time, I understand how these techniques work in terms of the mathematics, but by the time I come to look at them again, I’ve forgotten at least some of it. This especially applies to whenever I’ve tried to teach myself something like Bayesian stats/probability, or any time I read about things like neural networks, PCA, K-means, NLP techniques, as I don’t really use these in my role.

I wouldn’t say I’m a particularly forgetful person, it’s simply that I can’t remember all of these different statistical approaches and techniques in any great detail. Do I need know all of these well to be a good data scientist, or is it typical to end up “specialising” in one or two areas (E.g. predictive modelling, forecasting), depending on where you work?

On a side note - do I need to have a solid personal profile (E.g. GitHub projects) to do well in my career, or once I’ve got experience is that less relevant? I say that because outside of work, I prefer relaxing and doing other things that I enjoy - I really value work-life balance, and don’t necessarily care about making a ridiculous amount of money as long as I’m decently well paid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/146ofs6/how_do_you_remember_everything_theorycode_as_a/,JLane1996,270,Career,71,Top - year

I made a website that details NLP from beginning to end. It covers a lot of the foundational methods including primers on the usual stuff (LA, calc, etc.) all the way ""up to"" stuff like Transformers.

I know there's tons of resources already out there and you probably will get better explanations from YouTube videos and stuff but you could use this website as kind of a reference or maybe you could use it to clear something up that is confusing. I made it mostly for myself initially and some of the explanations later on are more my stream of consciousness than anything else but I figured I'd share anyway in case it is helpful for anyone. At worst, it at least is like an ordered walkthrough of NLP stuff

I'm sure there's tons of typos or just some things I wrote that I misunderstood so any comments or corrects are welcome, you can feel free to message me and I'll make the changes.

It's mostly just meant as a public resource and I'm not getting anything from this (don't mean for this to come across as self-promotion or anything) but yeah, have a look!

I have never had a manager in my entire career that provided any value to me,17cfb97,"In my entire career, I have never had a single manager that provided any value to me personally. Here's a recap of all of the managers I've had in my career. 


1. Terrific manager. Hired me, made me feel welcome, immediately left the company two weeks after I started



2. Replaced first manager, and immediately put me on performance improvement plan to try and get rid of me. Would find formatting errors, any sort of mistake or human error at all to tell me that I was a sloppy employee. Completely ignored any benefit I provided, and had no interest in working with me. Just wanted to build their own team, and I was in their way because I was already there


3. Hired me, and instead letting me get oriented into my role, decided to do what she called ""trial by fire"", just throw me into the deep and and see if I sink or swim. I excelled in my position, did everything better than expected, received praise often, but passed up for a promotion because only one person can be promoted. 


4. Completely incompetent, never actually did any of the subject that they were managing a team for. Ended up being fired for sexual harassment against many women on our team 



5. Came from another team to replace previous manager, gave me mountains of work and impossible goals and expectations to achieve, and even when achieving them, made up a bunch of excuses as to why I can't be promoted that made no sense. Glass ceiling, basically, can't be promoted unless you tell me that you want to be promoted, and X amount of years have passed, need X amount of outstanding performance reviews, etc


6. Actually a really good manager and all around good person. For the first year, great to work under them, they let me get situated in the role, let me get exposure to many different teams and departments, let me explore and provided coaching. However, after the first year, became very lazy as a manager. Never at their desk, always driving somewhere, scheduling meetings and then being 15 plus minutes late to them because again, they are driving somewhere, or not doing their job. Became extremely lazy and let errors slip through their fingers, and blame team members for them. Began making excuses when people wanted to be promoted 


7. The director above the previous manager in bullet point above. Completely worthless leader who came aboard to replace another director, and their first mission was to interrogate everyone on the team, and determine if their career goals were to stay in their current position. Anyone who desired career growth, or wanted to move up into management, or had career aspirations was immediately let go because they're ""Not a fit for our organizational goals"" 



The most common thing I have seen is that it is impossible to get promoted. Most positions at analyst level are designed so that no one can proceed into other positions because they want you to stay exactly where you are currently and not move up, they try to make it as difficult as possible for you to move up into other roles in the company. If you don't want to sit exactly where you are for at least 5 to 10 years, you're a bad employee, and there is no way to be promoted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17cfb97/i_have_never_had_a_manager_in_my_entire_career/,None,262,Discussion,133,Top - year

"R programmers, what are the greatest issues you have with Python?",15g96dc,"I'm a Data Scientist with a computer science background. When learning programming and data science I learned first through Python, picking up R only after getting a job. After getting hired I discovered many of my colleagues, especially the ones with a statistics or economics background, learned programming and data science through R.

Whether we use Python or R depends a lot on the project but lately, we've been using much more Python than R. My colleagues feel sometimes that their job is affected by this, but they tell me that they have issues learning Python, as many of the tutorials start by assuming you are a complete beginner so the content is too basic making them bored and unmotivated, but if they skip the first few classes, you also miss out on important snippets of information and have issues with the following classes later on.

Inspired by that I decided to prepare a Python course that:

1. Assumes you already know how to program
2. Assumes you already know data science
3. Shows you how to replicate your existing workflows in Python
4. Addresses the main pain points someone migrating from R to Python feels

The problem is, I'm mainly a Python programmer and have not faced those issues myself, so I wanted to hear from you, have you been in this situation? If you migrated from R to Python, or at least tried some Python, what issues did you have? What did you miss that R offered?

Data Science job is BORING but I have so much free time. May I have some advice?,1599njr,"I have been in my first DS job for almost 2 years now. It's really a Analyst job: dashboarding, basic queries, etc.

I have learned a good bit here: Python with Pandas and some basic linear regression, more ""complex"" SQL queries like multiple joins, CTEs, subqueries, and how to translate data into business needs.

The people here are all so nice and supportive, but there's nothing to do. Week after week it's the same requests, with an ad-hoc request maybe once every quarter. I have asked my team lead for more work or requests, but he says their is nothing at this time. I am pretty sure that the higher-ups know their is nothing to do, and part of me wonders if I'll be on the chopping block soon.

I have simply worked on kaggle projects until my eyes have bled, but for the past year I have just put a bottle of water on my spacebar to appear that I am online, then go walk my dog, go to the gym, play video games.

Hiring Market Seems Crazy,15pzmfu,"Or maybe I'm just doing something wrong. I just finished an MS in stats at a top 3 stats department, did my MS thesis research on self attention in transformers, undergrad double major in math and econ with CS minor, and I spent 1.5 years as a data science intern at a small but established sports analytics company during my masters program. Applying to upwards of 100 DS and machine learning roles online has landed me a total of zero (0) interviews.

First of all thanks to everyone offering their advice and perspective on my situation, and the job market at large. My goal here is to get a sense of whether or not there's a mismatch between my job hopes/expectations and my abilities, or if I'm just going about the job search incorrectly.

For those who asked for more details about my profile, I'll try to add some color here. I don't want to turn this into me listing my resume but maybe it will help me or others understand.

Some Relevant Skills:

Been programming in python for 6 years (web-scraping, pands, numpy, sklearn, pytorch, etc), practice leetcode pretty regularly. Have used for R for 3 years, but haven't touched it in about six months so a bit rusty. Lots of experience training and engineering neural nets in pytorch, this is my strongest skill imo. Have a few research projects using pytorch I did during my masters. Also obviously proficient with mathematical statistics and probability, the stuff you get from a stats ms.

​

Internship stuff:

Lots of people asked or brought up my internship, so I'll ad more about it. The company manages a large databse of college athletes and recruits and sells access and analysis to athletic programs. I joined as an intern winter of 2022, working part time during my masters. It's a small company with 10 full time employees, completely remote. There is one other programmer/tech guy but he mostly does does pandas/web-scraping/social media automation stuff, no stats/ml. There aren't any other data science/machine learning/stats people at the company, the owner/ceo has some experience and recently worked on a data sciency project but I think he spends most of his time managing the business. For the first 8 months I was essentially a software engineer/data engineer, writing python code to scrape and clean and move datasets. Last fall I started building a system that uses an llm to automate a monthly data entry project. This project was recurring every month, and usually took a group of 6 interns and 3 full time employees about a week to finish. My system now automates between 60% and 80% of it each month, most months its closer to 80%. The project is now typically done by two full time employees and maybe 1 intern. I'm now working on a project using boosted trees to find under/over recruited athletes. The owner/ceo of the company said I can add whatever title for my internship to my resume, since its a small company there aren't officially designated tracks or titles. I'm currently using ""Data Science Intern - Machine Learning"", but can change this to anything as long as it still accurately reflects what I've been doing.

​

Academic Stuff:

Thesis focused on self-attention in NMT and image classification, essentially showed that the common interpretation of self-attention working by ""comparing words in the input"" is wrong. Currently my advisor and I are working on extending the research, he wants to try to publish and so do I. 3.5 gpa in masters program (I know this isn't great but the school has a reputation for being hard/rigorous with no grade inflation, so maybe I'll be ok?). Undergrad GPA was 3.9, 4.0 if we only look at my major (few A- grades in humanities requirements). Was in honors program, wrote an honors thesis in math (algebraic geometry), got the ""best math student"" awards from my math department junior and senior year. I know since I have a master's the undergrad stuff is less important, but maybe that will help because it was a large non-elite university, mostly known for sports.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15pzmfu/hiring_market_seems_crazy/,badcheeseisbad,262,Career,187,Top - year
"What I wish I had known earlier in my career, particularly with disorganized companies",16y0vfi," I'm quoting directly from a Reddit user named funbike. This is the rule you should abide by in organizations. I also made the same mistake when I joined a company, attempting to prove myself.

"" 

After being a fool in my early career trying too hard to impress, this is how I handle this kind of thing these days:

* Document EVERYTHING. Follow-up verbal conversations with summary email. When things go south, I'll be able to prove I warned them.
* Give *realistic* estimates on how long things will take. Whatever I say is usually twice how long I actually think it will take, because things never go like you think.
* Make it clear that that longer-term estimates will be less accurate the farther out they are, because software is notoriously difficult to estimate.
* Tell them to their face that we *will not* make the unrealistic dates they've set, and to prevent in future to always consult first.
* I will *not* work overtime due to artificial deadlines. I'll do O/T for extreme exceptional cases only, such as a one-time short-term crisis or for a regulatory-mandated deadline. By 6pm I'll be at my house.
* Explain quality should never be abandoned for speed. It will violently backfire in the end, with the opposite effect.

I stand my ground. I can make them mildly unhappy now, or furiously disappointed in our results in the future. I'll take the first one please.

Even if you were to heroically meet their unreasonable date, they'll just expect more next time. You'll burn out and maybe the next time you'll have an embarrassing failure even with crazy overtime. They'll say ""tsk, tsk"" and blame you.

Constant work anxiety is making me question data analytics as my choice of field,135fybw,"I'm 22, currently pursing masters and working part-time with 2 (part-time) yoe as a data analyst in banking. I am hoping to eventually transition into data science.

While my job has definitely made life more comfortable financially, it's also taken a toll on my well-being due to the constant anxiety it causes me. This anxiety stems from worrying about various things, but the most significant would simply be the accuracy of results. 

I manage several reports and metrics calculations. Every time I am reporting it to the upper management, no matter how much time I spend double-checking everything, I spend the next week worying whether I could have messed up somewhere and how it would make me look like an incompetent idiot.

Machine Learning pays 15-40% more than Data Science - why?,16urri3,,https://i.redd.it/r8y8ds6oa2rb1.png,pg860,244,Career,123,Top - year
Non-technical boss wants me to present results of a extremely ill-performing model to executives,181okvd,"My background, in case it's relevant: I have a masters and PhD in data science, and I've been in my first data science role for about a year and a half.


I am a data scientist in a business intelligence department. When I joined, I inherited an extremely poor churn model - like ~10% precision, ~5% recall, ~91% accurate (due to imbalance). This thing was in production for over a year because my manager didn't realize that accuracy is a poor metric to use for imbalanced data.


I've spent the last year and a half redoing this model myself to a place where it is a lot better. But, my manager wants me to present the old model to executives. Now, if this were simply a comparison of the old one and the new one or an examination into why the old one didn't work so well, that would be fine. That's not what he wants. He wants me to present the model as if its predictions are perfect in order to show executives areas that we need to improve on in order to prevent churn.


This... makes no sense. E.g., let's say the old model classified old customers as most at-risk, but it's newer customers who actually churn more. Basing business decisions on the model's poor predictions is a really bad idea. 


To be clear, I don't have a problem making these slides. I have pushed back on the idea behind it, but I've never refused to do it. What I'm concerned about is that it's my name that's going on this and it's going to be presented as my sole effort, albeit from within the department, even though it's a model I had no hand in building whatsoever. My boss also has a tendency to throw people under the bus, and I feel like I'm being sacrificed.


I see a few options:


1. I can carefully word things so that I do not invite any conclusions drawn from my presentation whatsoever and also gently shut down any possible business decisions that might be made from this presentation.


2. I present it the way my boss wants but stay honest when anyone asks about the actual churn results and how much they differ from the model.


So basically, my questions are:


* Do I need to shut up and do as I'm told and act like a cog in the business machine? 


* Is this really normal business practice that I need to get used to? 


* Am I being dramatic?


* Or do I right to have a problem with this request? 


I am coming from academia where every little decision in the modeling process has to be justified and everything gets examined by multiple people, so maybe this is me just struggling to adapt to corporate life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/181okvd/nontechnical_boss_wants_me_to_present_results_of/,goatsnboots,242,Career Discussion,87,Top - year
Unrealistic entry-level position expectations?,1380neq,"We are currently interviewing for entry-level candidates for a data scientist position with image-related applications. Most the candidates have had a masters qualification in 'data science' and most have had CNN experience listed on their CV. However they have not been able to convincingly answer the following questions:

* You mention CNNs on your CV; can you explain what a convolution is?

They may talk about masks and 'sliding'  but cannot go into the details of the mathematical operation.

* Can you explain a Type I and Type II error? What is a common trade-off between the two?

Complete blank from all candidates. If I clarify false-positive and false-negative the best candidates point out the importance of context but don't know about trade-offs.

* Your CV lists scikit learn, what is kNN clustering? How might you determine the optimum k parameter?

Most can explain kNN, the best candidates have suggested plotting the clusters with the data and eyeballing it however no-one has mentioned elbow or silhouette plots.

Is it unreasonable to expect solid answers to these questions?

Edit: I've quite rightly got criticism for confusing kNN and k-means. I should clarify that I have misrepresented a question from another interviewer. She sometimes asked if the candidate could explain kNN when it arose in the context of Nan replacement for data cleaning. Other times she asked if they knew about unsupervised learning and when k-means came up she would ask how do you determine k. She never asked about both during the same interview which I now understand was probably intentional but I had assumed she was asking about the same thing.


I should also clarify these were intended as 'stretch' questions and the majority of the interview was questions like 'can you tell us about the project you have listed on the application?'.

Companies should give employees a whole week (with no expected deliverables) dedicated to learning each year,1abk6du,"DS and analytics is a vast field and most employees will have gaps in their knowledge/skill that need to be filled.

I feel many know what it is that they want to learn but cannot find time for it with their work load. And therefore, a dedicated learning week which can set expectations with all stakeholders that DS/analytics team is upgrading is must have. Maybe even employees can do knowledge sharing at end of week or start of next week. 

Company can eventually provide learning resources (courses, workshops, trainers etc.) but they shouldn't restrict employees on what they need to learn. It should at max be a discussion between employee and manager, where manager puts in suggestions but employee takes the final call.

Does anyone not really care about ChatGPT and LLMs?,14a8cx4,"Sorry in advance if this post becomes a rant or is overly negative. I don't mean it to be.

So on one hand ChatGPT and LLMs are really impressive. It's really cool you can give a prompt and get a response that is almost or exactly what you asked for. But I'm already tried of hearing everyone talk about it constantly.

The fact it can create code is amazing, however it can ""hallucinate"" and create package and functions that don't exist... I mean, this is impressive, but is this useful? To create boilerplate code that you have to review before using? Why not write it from scratch? Even if the LLM gives you code that is syntactically correct, is it even quality code?

"Why some data science interviews suck, as an interviewer...",17kvjmp,"I know a number of people express annoyance at interviews on this sub. I was raked over the coals a few months ago for apparently bad interview questions but my latest experience blows that out the water. I thought I'd give my experience from the other side of the desk which may go some way to showing why it can be so bad.

I received a message last week saying that an online assessor for a Graduate Data Scientist role had dropped out and they needed volunteers to stand in. I volunteered to help.

Someone from HR sent me an email with a link to a training video and the interview platform. I watched the 30 min video at 1.5 speed which was mostly stuff like which buttons to press.

The day before I logged onto the assessment portal I reviewed the questions. I noticed that the questions were very generic but thought there might be some 'calibration' briefing before the interviews; it was too late to speak to HR.

Before the assessment day there was a HR call 30 mins before. It turned out to be just to check if anyone had technical issues. There was no 'calibration' brief. The call ended after 10 mins as the HR rep had to leave to chase no shows.

I was dropped straight into a 'technical' interview 1 on 1 with the candidate. Although it was apparently technical most of the questions were very generic. E.g. Walk me through a project where you had to solve a problem.

There were criteria associated with the questions but there was no way you would answer them as the interviewee unless prompted. E.g in the above question a criterion might be 'The candidate readily accepts new ideas'. Given the short time (5 mins per question) it was not really possible to prompt for every criterion but I did try to enable the candidate to score highly but it meant the questioning was very disjointed.

After a few of these there was the 'technical' section. These questions seemed to be totally left-field. E.g. you have two identical-size metal cubes how could you differentiate the material they are made of? Obviously this question is useless for the role and the CS-background interviewee needed lots of coaching to answer this.

Next I had a soft skills interview with a different candidate. The questions again were vague and sensible answers would not meet the criteria.

Finally there was a group activity and we were supposed to observe the 'teamwork' but the team just split the tasks and got on with them individually so there was hardly anything to observe.

After this the HR bod asked us to complete all the assessments and submit them. Then we'd have a 'wash up'. The wash up was basically the place where scoring could be calibrated by discussing with the other assessors. Of course, the scores had already been submitted by then so this was entirely pointless.

I also asked about the inappropriate technical questions and they said they didn't get the DS questions in time so had just used other technical questions (we were hiring other engineers/scientists at the same time).

So, as you can see, HR ruin everything they touch and hiring is a HR process so it's terrible. Sorry if you had to go through this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17kvjmp/why_some_data_science_interviews_suck_as_an/,nth_citizen,221,Career Discussion,57,Top - year

I now manage a few other team members (who were there before me). They are all contractors and their day rate is HIGH. They are all 'Data Scientists' and graduates.

I'm older. I've done lots of technical roles and I'm not really sure what my official title is. I can do data science but I really just build stuff. I've done Data Engineering in the past, MLOps, DevOps, Cloud etc. I'm a jack of all trades, master of none.

Now, I know what ***I think*** a 'Data Scientist' should be able to do:

1. Pandas, Numpy, Scikit learn, matplotlib blah blah blah
2. Version control (Git)
3. Managing virtual environments
4. Debugging within an IDE
5. Scoping out a project, ideation, exploration
6. Report writing skills/communication skills
7. Some exposure to clean code conventions (PEP-8)
8. Some exposure to SQL like syntax
9. bit of linux would be cool (I can teach them)
10. bit of cloud would be cool (I can teach them)

"[P] Just released the first batch of 1,000 perfectly synchronised AI sex toy scripts for 180º POV VR porn videos",165s4dn,"We started exploring automated scripts creation for 180º POV VR porn videos some two years ago as these were in strong demand on the SexLikeReal platform. The idea of interactive sex toys is to perfectly match the movement in the video with up to frame precision. It's an up and down stroker realtime synced with a video player while watching VR (also works with smartphones now).

Only 1 in 20 videos was scripted and the gap was growing exponentially. It takes up to two weeks to script manually. There are some very few people on Earth knowing the craft and the demand is growing fast with interactive sex toys hitting the market and becoming popular. Now we are looking to render 1,000 scripts in an hour.

We trained the model on 1,300 craft scripts created over many years and started to fine tune algorithms working hard with script creators and testers. One step after another and it started getting better. What was expected to be somewhat ok turned to be a cool product with quality much better than expected.

The scripts are generated at first pass. There was a manual QA in place while testing. Now it becomes a problem as we don't have capacity to come over thousands of scripts.

It's the first successful AI scripts attempt 🔥

Are all higher level data science jobs like this?,17jtkgv,"I'm really not sure how to summarize this concisely in a neat title, so just let me explain.

At previous lower level jobs, we were organized. We had ticketing tracking systems, step-by-step procedures for all of the commonly done work, we had checklists that people could sign off on as they completed work. And most importantly, even for one-off requests, the primary mode of communication was email. That way, I had the project specifications and/or updates spelled out in front of me that I could refer back to whenever needed.

As I get higher up in the field at different companies, I'm finding the primary mode of communication is virtual meetings. All of the background, specifications, and next steps are given verbally, and I'm sitting here in these meetings furiously trying to write everything down that is being said. What's worse is that the ideas for the projects often aren't fully developed and we have to figure them out so I get a lot of ""do this, actually no, let's do it this way, but I'm actually thinking it would be better to approach it this way....."". AS you can imagine it makes fully understanding the next steps of a given projects difficult. If I use my judgement and approach it the way I feel is best, half the time it's end up not being what management wants and I have to waste their time and mine on rework. 

One of the ways I tried to work around management's brain dumps on me was to recap back to them what the next steps they wanted from me were, but they're ***super busy*** so they always join the meetings late, and as a result we frequently run out of time.  75% of the time I try to message or email them with questions they just don't respond, so the only way I can get any info out of them is via virtual meetings. This is creating an environment for me that makes mistakes easier to happen, and it's turning into a situation where I can do 9 things right, but if I missed or misunderstood the 10th thing, I'm getting crucified for it (meanwhile this is a common occurrence for management but that's a different rant.....) I'm being made to feel like it's a shortcoming of mine for not being able to take down everything accurately.

I know some people can thrive in these conditions. For me, it's tough.

Will being data analyst in casino resort ruin my career?,178fhbg,"Updated:

Thank you so much for all the suggestions and comments! The community is so supportive and enthusiastic. I read every comments very carefully, probably more than one time for most, and they are very insightful and play a vital role in my decision making, whether thumbs up or down.

I have been thinking about this almost every minutes in the past few days. In the end, I decided to take this offer. For me this decision is very complicated. Actually I am not sure how long I will stay, but it's always important to make my first step.

Thank you again for all the comments! 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

As a new graduate recently I am getting a data analyst offer from a casino resort. It's a hard time for new grad and after two times of withdrawals of my offers, this is the only one I have in my hands. The job duty is about analyzing campaign performance, analyzing customer patterns, and forecasting business trends.  They are also working on breaking data silos utilizing cloud service so ETL jobs should also be expected.

Overall the project sounds pretty attractive to me. My only concern is the business itself. One of my friends (not in US) gave me a strong suggestion that don't easily go into this industry. He was working in an operation role for company building mobile casinos, and the business logic was so different from other industries that it's hard to get out of this. Many people have a bias toward this career so he had a hard time changing jobs.

I am scared, to be honest. But I am not sure to what extent his thoughts work in my scenario. Casino Resort still looks much different from mobile casinos and his role was not data analyst. I wonder how you guys think about this.  Should I take this offer?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/178fhbg/will_being_data_analyst_in_casino_resort_ruin_my/,BladeClickerQQ,213,Discussion,130,Top - year
Haven’t done a single thing at new job,14mc089,"I just started a new job this past Monday at a large financial services company as a data analyst. I haven’t done a single thing all week.

I’ve been reaching out to the service desk all week and nothing has happened. Any suggestions?

Im taking a Udemy course (while I sit here with no work) on Power BI since I haven’t used it much and am going to work with it at some point if I ever get access. 

Are big companies always like this? Im coming from a smaller startup where if I needed something I either downloaded it from the internet myself or I got access within an hour. This is just painful I’m not even sure why I was told to come in this week, I literally can’t do anything.

EDIT: thanks everyone for the replies, not feeling as guilty for doing nothing now.

Bouncing back after a bad work experience as a data scientist in an organization,12g7hdy,"Hi everyone,

I had to quit my job as a senior data scientist in my company because of constant negative feedback from my managers, stress and health issues. I lost my confidence completely once I was put on a PIP and quit my job the next day. I don't have a job right now. 

I feel it's really hard but not impossible to bounce back from this ""failure"". First of all, I'm taking some time off to take care of my physical and mental health by doing strength training, meditation and Yoga, working on my diet, spending time with family etc. 

Secondly, I'm trying to focus on my strengths (computer vision and deep learning) and working on toy problems related to object detection and segmentation to get my mojo back. But the sheer amount of stuff that a data scientist is supposed to know is just too overwhelming for me. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? If yes, how did you bounce back from it? I'd love to read your stories.

"How complex ARE your models in Industry, really? (Imposter Syndrome)",1akjw7t,"Perhaps some imposter syndrome, or perhaps not...**basically--how complex ARE your models, realistically, for industry purposes?** 

""Industry Purposes"" in the sense of answering business questions, such as:

* Build me a model that can predict whether a free user is going to convert to a paid user. (Prediction)
* Here's data from our experiment on Button A vs. Button B, which Button should we use? (Inference)
* Based on our data from clicks on our website, should we market towards Demographic A? (Inference)

I guess inherently I'm approaching this scenario from a prediction or inference perspective, and not from like a ""building for GenAI or Computer Vision"" perspective.

------------------

I know (and have experienced) that a lot of the work in Data Science is prepping and cleaning the data, but I always feel a little imposter syndrome when I spend the bulk of my time doing that, and then throw the data into a package that creates like a ""black-box"" Random Forest model that spits out the model we ultimately use or deploy.

Sure, along the way I spend time tweaking the model parameters (for a Random Forest example--tuning # of trees or depth) and checking my train/test splits, communicating with stakeholders, gaining more domain knowledge, etc., but ""creating the model"" once the data is cleaned to a reasonable degree is just loading things into a package and letting it do the rest. Feels a little too simple and cheap in some respects...especially for the salaries commanded as you go up the chain.

And since a lot of money is at stake based on the model performance, it's always a little nerve-wracking to hinge yourself on some black-box model that performed well on your train/test data and ""hope"" it generalizes to unseen data and makes the company some money.

Definitely much less stressful when it's just projects for academics or hypotheticals where there's no real-world repercussions...there's always that voice in the back of my head saying ""surely, something as simple as this needs to be improved for the company to deem it worth investing so much time/money/etc. into, right?""

------------------

Anyone else feel this way? Normal feeling--get used to it over time? Or is it that the more experience you gain, the bulk of ""what you are paid for"" isn't necessarily developing complex or novel algorithms for a business question, but rather how you communicate with stakeholders and deal with data-related issues, or similar stuff like that...?

------------------

**EDIT: Some good discussion about what types of models people use on a daily basis for work, but beyond saying ""I use Random Forest/XGBoost/etc."", do you incorporate more complexity besides the ""simple"" pipeline of: Clean Data -> Import into Package and do basic Train/Test + Hyperparameter Tuning + etc., -> Output Model for Use?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1akjw7t/how_complex_are_your_models_in_industry_really/,Joe10112,201,Discussion,152,Top - year

My work published without my name. Need your advice,15wasa1,"This is probably something that has been discussed a lot. However, I want to share my story and get your feedback. 

A few years ago, I was part of an unofficial research group. No contracts or any type of payment was involved. The lead of the group was a university professor. 

During that period, a colleague and I worked on a project with a case study of a prediction model. My colleague did the machine learning model and I designed the architecture and developed a platform that consumed the model and provided results and visualisations. 

We submitted it to a competition as a group but we didn’t get the first place. 

Fast forward. I am in industry now and don’t have plans to return to academia. Found out that a few months ago, that work got published in a journal with Author 1: my colleague, Author 2: the professor and Author 3 someone external that never worked on it. 

I was never asked about it. Author 1 said that he tried to include me but Author 2 was against it since I am not part of the group anymore. There are other dependencies between the two and he didn’t want to push it more. 

It’s not an innovation or an impressive work. I never thought of publishing it. However I feel cheated. 

The code of the platform is in my personal gitlab and I have mail communications explaining to others how to install and use it. 

I don’t want to create any issue to author 1. But how do you think I should handle this? I only ended up mentioning in the acknowledgement section.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15wasa1/my_work_published_without_my_name_need_your_advice/,CuriousTasos,201,Discussion,79,Top - year

I was just asked to fudge the numbers,12qzs1k,"This particular project is for client-facing stakeholders. My team lead and I are tasked with automating several of their data-driven slides on Tableau that they currently manually produce not sure how or where.

One particular slide is a pie chart (yeah, I know) that splits the data into ~10 different segments or so, each with its % of market share.

We did so, and they complained that the numbers percentage points add up to 98%.

We explained that it's because of rounding, and if we included the decimal it would add up to 100%.

They started going on about how they present this to CFOs and they'll ask why it doesn't add up to 100% and it has to be perfect and etc.

So we offered to show the decimal, but nope, can't do that because it's ""hard to read.""

Remember how they produce those manually at the moment? They said, and I quote, ""sometimes I change a 3% to a 4% to make it work, because what's 1% more?""

I can kind of understand changing 20% to 21%, because that's only a 5% difference. But really, 3% to 4%? A whopping 33% difference?

Anyway, I'm not about to tell them how to do their job, since I can barely do mine. Lord knows I have no idea how to automate this arbitrary number-fudging on Tableau, so I'll have to figure that one out (it has to be automated so that it adds up to 100% no matter what data ranges the user chooses).

Can you have a successful career in this industry/field if you aren’t obsessed with it?,1bjj6hv,"I write this purely out of curiosity because I’m wondering if anyone else can relate to my situation.

I’m [M27] a Senior Data Analyst in the UK, with a Physics background and PhD. I’ve generally always enjoyed learning and understand new concepts and ideas. 

After my PhD I left academia for industry - not because I didn’t like my subject, but because I wanted a permanent role away from the toxicity and pressure/risk of academia, with a 9-5 where I can switch off at the end of the day. Data seemed like a good starting point since I’d worked with it in my PhD.

On top of that, I didn’t want my subject to become my life - I enjoy far too many things outside of work to want to do it in my free time - I like sports, gaming, travelling, going for coffee, and all that lot. 

So, when I see people talking about their personal projects on GitHub it starts to make me wonder or question whether I’m in the right industry. Even when somebody creates a graph or produces some stats related to something I’m interested in, like Fantasy Premier League, it’s cool, but I have no desire to go and do that myself.

This is leading me to worry that long-term, I worry that I won’t be able to compete with the people who do genuinely live and breathe data 24/7. I’m just not “obsessed” with it. I see it as a job. 

I also don’t want my lack of “obsession” (if you want to call it that) be perceived for a lack of motivation or being someone who is lazy. I still want to progress over time, but above all I want to be comfortable.

Does anyone else feel the same way?

Initially, I thought the barrier was a lack of vision among decision-makers, but as I climbed the corporate ladder, I discovered the real challenge was not just creating groundbreaking projects, but ensuring their adoption within the company.

Do you also wrap your data processing functions in classes?,1bmoyzu,"I work in a team of data scientists on time series forecasting pipelines, and I have the feeling that my colleagues overuse OOP paradigms. Let us say we have two dataframes, and we have a set of functions which calculates some deltas between them:

    def calculate_delta(df1: pd.DataFrame, df2: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        delta = # some calculations incl. more functions
        return delta
    
    delta = calculate_delta(df1, df2)

What my coleagues usually do with this, that they wrap this function in a class, something like:

    class DeltaCalculatorProcessor:
        def __init__(self, df1: pd.DataFrame, df2: pd.DataFrame):
            self.__df1 = df1
            self.__df2 = df2
            self.__delta = pd.DataFrame()
    
        def calculate_delta(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
            ... # update self.__delta calculated from self.__df1 and self.__df2 using more class methods
            return self.__delta

And then they call it with

    dcp = DeltaCalculatorProcessor(df1, df2)
    delta = dcp.calculate_delta()

They always do this, even if they don't use this class more than once, so practically they just add yet another abstraction layer on the top of a set of functions, saying that ""this is how professional software developers do"", ""this is industrial best practice"" etc.

Do you also do this in your team? Maybe I have PTSD from having been a Java programmer before for ages, but I find the excessive use of classes for code structuring actually harder to maintain than just simply organizing the codes with functions, especially for data pipelines (where the input is a set of dataframes and the output is also a set of dataframes).

P.S. I wanted to keep my example short, so I haven't shown more smaller functions inside calculate_delta(). But the emphasis is not that they would wrap 1 single function in a class; but that they wrap a set of functions in a class without any further reasons (the wrapper class is not re-used, there is no internal state to maintain etc.). So the full app could be organized with pure functions, they just wrap the functions in ""Processor"" and ""Orchestrator"" classes, using one time classes for code organization.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bmoyzu/do_you_also_wrap_your_data_processing_functions/,Asleep-Dress-3578,197,Coding,95,Top - year

Why so many people think that having a PhD (or postdoc) is an easy pass for getting a job in data science?,16np8v9,"Hey!

Some posts on this subreddit recently left me wondering why so many people with PhDs think that's an easy pass for data science. 

I get that a PhD is counted towards work experience (and rightly so) but it's still very much different compared to **modern** data science where the required skillset is far broader and tends to cover things from prototyping to deployment. 

Or perhaps I'm mistaken and a PhD undeniably makes a candidate stronger and more competitive (feel free to challenge me on that as I'm really not sure)

My intuition is that a PhD sort of gives guarantees that the candidate can work independently as well as in a team and can conduct research and analysis. As for knowledge expertise, don't you feel like that most DS jobs aren't actually SOTA research of the likes of Meta and Netflix (thus a PhD doesn't really add up much value to the equation)?

In this article, we'll embark on a journey to demystify vector databases, unravelling the fundamental concepts, applications, and their indispensable role in supporting and harnessing the potential of cutting-edge AI models.

In the world of AI, large language models heavily rely on vector embeddings, which are representations of data that carry semantic information. These embeddings have numerous attributes or features, making them complex to manage. In simple terms, the process of converting raw data into vectors is crucial to preserve information and relationships. To achieve this, we employ an embedding model that takes the raw data as input and generates vector embeddings. By passing the raw data through the embedding model, we ensure that the resulting vector embeddings retain significant information and capture the underlying relationships present in the data. This conversion enables efficient processing, analysis, and comparisons of the data in a more compact and meaningful vector representation.

[Vector Embedding Process](https://preview.redd.it/5hufgl68z38b1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc0518393865f472b63a3d3943a4cd1c64d1f2a7)

Traditional databases struggle to handle the scale and complexity of this data, hindering real-time analysis and insights. That's where vector databases come in.

Vector databases are designed specifically to handle vector embeddings, offering performance, scalability, and flexibility. They enable advanced features like semantic information retrieval and long-term memory for AI models. Here's how they work:

1. Generating Embeddings: An embedding model creates vector embeddings for the content we want to index, capturing essential patterns and relationships.
2. Inserting into the Database: The vector embeddings are inserted into the vector database, along with references to the original content they were created from.
3. Querying the Database: When an application issues a query, the same embedding model generates embeddings for the query. These query embeddings are used to search the vector database for similar vector embeddings.
4. Retrieving Associated Content: The vector database returns similar embeddings along with the associated original content.

**How does a vector database work?**

Unlike traditional databases that match exact values, vector databases use similarity metrics to find the most similar vectors to a query. They employ algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, optimizing search through techniques like hashing, quantization, or graph-based search.

A typical vector database pipeline includes:

1. Indexing: Vectors are indexed using algorithms like PQ, LSH, or HNSW, mapping them to a data structure for faster searching.
2. Querying: The vector database compares the indexed query vector with the indexed vectors in the dataset to find the nearest neighbours based on similarity.
3. Post Processing: In some cases, the vector database retrieves the nearest neighbours from the dataset and applies additional processing, such as re-ranking using a different similarity measure, to provide the final results.

By employing these techniques, vector databases offer fast and accurate retrieval, striking a balance between speed and accuracy.

In summary, vector databases are tailored for managing vector embeddings, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of complex AI data.

From Data-Driven to Data-Ignored… a disappointing shift at Amazon,15jzuh8,"https://preview.redd.it/3n4q0xzevjgb1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=38bb199895cb4217c70a1a0f1431ee721d26f45b

I couldn't help but feel the need to share my frustration with the way some executives handle decision-making processes, especially when it comes to “data-driven” decisions. The recent example from Amazon's senior leadership really got me boiling, and I just had to get this off my chest.

As a data science practitioner myself… it's disheartening to see executives in both my field and beyond often using data points to validate their existing beliefs rather than *truly* utilizing data to guide their decisions. The cornerstone of our work is to analyze and interpret data objectively to uncover insights that inform strategic choices. Yet, time and again, we witness decisions driven by personal preferences and opinions rather than evidence.

Amazon has long been regarded as a paragon of data-driven decision-making, and rightly so. The company has access to vast amounts of data and has used it effectively to shape their strategies and operations, such as Dynamic Pricing, Warehouse Optimization, and Fraud Detection. However, when I read about Mike Hopkins' statements regarding the return to office, I was shocked at the blatant disregard for fundamental data-driven principles.

Let's break this down… Hopkins, a senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, made a bold statement in an internal meeting, stating that it's time to return to the office without providing *any* substantial data to back up his claim. He says, ""I don't have data to back it up, but I know it's better.""

The essence of data-driven decision-making lies in using objective data to support or reject a belief or hypothesis. By admitting that he lacks the data to back up his position, Hopkins is essentially admitting that he's making an uninformed decision, and worse yet, he's trying to influence others to follow suit blindly.

What's even more infuriating is that this kind of behavior is not *that* uncommon among senior management, even in my own personal experience. Many of them already have preconceived notions or personal preferences, and they cherry-pick data points to support their beliefs while conveniently ignoring any data that contradicts them. The complete opposite of what Data Science is meant to achieve.

Data-driven decision-making is crucial, especially when it comes to complex matters like remote work. Many employees have adapted to working from home, and some even prefer it due to increased flexibility and work-life balance. Forcing a return to the office without concrete data to support the move is a clear sign of executive arrogance and a lack of respect for their employees' preferences and well-being.

It's hard to believe that a company as data-driven as Amazon wouldn't have data on the productivity and effectiveness of remote work… the company likely has access to a *trove* of information that could shed light on the effectiveness of remote work, including productivity metrics, employee satisfaction surveys, and more. It's puzzling why they would not utilize this data to inform their decisions, especially when the well-being and productivity of their workforce are at stake. Without clear and data-backed justifications, employees may feel undervalued and may question the credibility of leadership's intentions.

Amazon's senior leadership should remember their commitment to data-driven principles and engage in transparent decision-making. If there are legitimate reasons to return to the office, they owe it to their employees to present the data and engage in an open discussion about the pros and cons. By withholding critical information, they are undermining trust and potentially making decisions that could hurt the company in the long run.

As a data science practitioner, I believe it's not just about having access to data; it's also about using it responsibly and ethically. Using data to back up preconceived beliefs, or worse, hiding data that counters those beliefs, undermines the credibility and ethics of data science as a field and the trust we place in data-driven decision-making.

In conclusion, the misuse and omission of data by executives is not only frustrating to witness but also detrimental to the progress of organizations. I find it incredibly disappointing that executives at Amazon, a company known for being data-driven, would advocate for a return to the office without any supporting data. As data scientists, we have a responsibility to advocate for the ethical and rigorous use of data, and as consumers and employees, we have the right to demand evidence-based decision-making from the companies we support.

Am I alone in this? I'd love to hear the community’s thoughts on this matter.

TL;DR: Amazon's senior leadership's recent push for a return to office without any supporting data is a disappointment to their reputation as a data-driven company. Executives should practice what they preach and make decisions based on objective data rather than personal beliefs or preferences. This behavior is not only disrespectful to employees but also detrimental to the company's long-term success. When data takes a backseat it flies in the face of what Data Science is all about.

WTF do people use SAS for?

What I'm wondering though is, if it comes a time when I decide to search for a similar role in a different company, what would this fake title do to my resume?

Would it be a good thing, perhaps because most hiring managers would prefer reading that over reading something like ""Data Analyst"" or whatever?

"Boss said, ""Choose your title"" - what to call myself?",13lyg2f,"So I am in the middle of my undergrad - studying data science - and while school is out for the summer, I got connected through some friends to work at a corporate office that manages HR and accounting for a handful of restaurants. They hired me to help them put together better spreadsheets and figure out better ways to do anything that's on a computer more efficiently (I don't have any formal qualifications for whatever that is called, and I'm pretty young, but it's just the kind of thing I've always sort of done with any kind of project in school or other jobs where excel was used. I like efficiency). Also they just don't really have the time to sit down and work through this stuff because of their deadlines so they have been doing a lot of things manually - they just switched to paperless for everything. We have an IT guy so I'm mostly just in MS office, not doing anything like that.

Anywho, I've been working here for almost a month now and I really enjoy it. They have lots of different forms and spreadsheets for me to have lots of projects with. I've come up with some ideas for better overall processes and been working with restaurant management to do basic stuff on their reports like using at least a .csv instead of a .pdf so that we can pull the data from it. Today my boss asked that I put my signature at the bottom of my email so it was a natural chance to ask what my title is (we never really talked about it) and they said to put down something ""that reflects what you’re doing and will look good on your resume""... So I can pretty much take it however I want. Any ideas, gang?

Visualizing What Batch Normalization Is and Its Advantages,1aihddg," Optimizing your neural network training with Batch Normalization 

[Visualizing What Batch Normalization Is and Its Advantages](https://preview.redd.it/dah6fe3kgigc1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f8a08ae05cf2989d109ae274b6f65e5cc83002)

# Introduction

 Have you, when conducting deep learning projects, ever encountered a situation where the more layers your neural network has, the slower the training becomes? 

 If your answer is YES, then congratulations, it's time for you to consider using batch normalization now. 

# What is Batch Normalization?

 As the name suggests, batch normalization is a technique where batched training data, after activation in the current layer and before moving to the next layer, is standardized. Here's how it works: 

1. *The entire dataset is randomly divided into N batches without replacement, each with a mini\_batch size, for the training.*
2. *For the i-th batch, standardize the data distribution within the batch using the formula:* *(Xi - Xmean) / Xstd**.*
3. *Scale and shift the standardized data with* *γXi + β* *to allow the neural network to undo the effects of standardization if needed.*

 The steps seem simple, don't they? So, what are the advantages of batch normalization? 

# Advantages of Batch Normalization

### Speeds up model convergence

 Neural networks commonly adjust parameters using gradient descent. If the cost function is smooth and has only one lowest point, the parameters will converge quickly along the gradient. 

 But if there's a significant variance in the data distribution across nodes, the cost function becomes less like a pit bottom and more like a valley, making the convergence of the gradient exceptionally slow. 

 Confused? No worries, let's explain this situation with a visual: 

 First, prepare a virtual dataset with only two features, where the distribution of features is vastly different, along with a target function: 

    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
    
    A = rng.uniform(1, 10, 100)
    B = rng.uniform(1, 200, 100)
    
    y = 2*A + 3*B + rng.normal(size=100) * 0.1  # with a little bias

 Then, with the help of GPT, we use matplot3d to visualize the gradient descent situation before data standardization: 

[ Visualization of cost functions without standardization of data.  ](https://preview.redd.it/s7zorqm9higc1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=f92388f9e3384eee96ce2585b7bc70f25392cee9)

 Notice anything? Because one feature's span is too large, the function's gradient is stretched long in the direction of this feature, creating a valley. 

 Now, for the gradient to reach the bottom of the cost function, it has to go through many more iterations. 

 But what if we standardize the two features first? 

    def normalize(X):
        mean = np.mean(X)
        std = np.std(X)
        return (X - mean)/std
    
    A = normalize(A)
    B = normalize(B)

 Let's look at the cost function after data standardization: 

[ Visualization of standardized cost functions for data. ](https://preview.redd.it/5ou0awyehigc1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c3f4dd14b78d52f0fe1396a0c131d19e0f6aea)

 Clearly, the function turns into the shape of a bowl. The gradient simply needs to descend along the slope to reach the bottom. Isn't that much faster? 

### Slows down the problem of gradient vanishing

 The graph we just used has already demonstrated this advantage, but let's take a closer look. 

 Remember this function? 

[ Visualization of sigmoid function.  ](https://preview.redd.it/jl3cyhojhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c2e2047317d99d89b9232b37fa28652eb10f7bd)

 Yes, that's the sigmoid function, which many neural networks use as an activation function. 

 Looking closely at the sigmoid function, we find that the slope is steepest between -2 and 2. 

[ The slope of the sigmoid function is steepest between -2 and 2. ](https://preview.redd.it/j6l02trmhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=504efbe5562e9b477a4c48e943011dca7bab5fa7)

 If we reduce the standardized data to a straight line, we'll find that these data are distributed exactly within the steepest slope of the sigmoid. At this point, we can consider the gradient to be descending the fastest. 

[ The normalized data will be distributed in the steepest interval of the sigmoid function. ](https://preview.redd.it/kk0mrflphigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=43d1dbc9b1a63952a41730146bfd624db97b2b4d)

 However, as the network goes deeper, the activated data will drift layer by layer (Internal Covariate Shift), and a large amount of data will be distributed away from the zero point, where the slope gradually flattens. 

[ The distribution of data is progressively shifted within the neural network. ](https://preview.redd.it/6y088bkthigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ebded75578b8a0daad7874d3803b926db74363)

 At this point, the gradient descent becomes slower and slower, which is why with more neural network layers, the convergence becomes slower. 

 If we standardize the data of the mini\_batch again after each layer's activation, the data for the current layer will return to the steeper slope area, and the problem of gradient vanishing can be greatly alleviated. 

[ The renormalized data return to the region with the steepest slope.  ](https://preview.redd.it/pmkgqpuwhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ce3916984707d86f314a3dc458f403b0584999)

### Has a regularizing effect

 If we don't batch the training and standardize the entire dataset directly, the data distribution would look like the following: 

[ Distribution after normalizing the entire data set. ](https://preview.redd.it/a0nuru70iigc1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bd763b5d450599cb6527089e01b0a1735aac4cb)

 However since we divide the data into several batches and standardize the data according to the distribution within each batch, the data distribution will be slightly different. 

[ Distribution of data sets after normalization by batch. ](https://preview.redd.it/of8wlwc2iigc1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ad7cf81a7c08512399e7681ff3bce8568d11e7)

 You can see that the data distribution has some minor noise, similar to the noise introduced by Dropout, thus providing a certain level of regularization for the neural network. 

## Conclusion

 Batch normalization is a technique that standardizes the data from different batches to accelerate the training of neural networks. It has the following advantages: 

* Speeds up model convergence.
* Slows down the problem of gradient vanishing.
* Has a regularizing effect.

\[EDIT 2\]: Definition of analysts

Since many people asked to refine the definition of the analyst, I did so.

With the following definition:

""Proper Analyst"" is a person who:

\- has 'analyst' in the job title and (A or B or C)

where

A:

has keywords related to any the following data platforms /tools mentioned in the job description:  Index(\['Databricks', 'Snowflake', 'Amazon Redshift', 'Google BigQuery',        'Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics', 'Alteryx', 'Apache Kafka',        'Teradata', 'Cloudera', 'Hortonworks', 'Apache Hadoop', 'Tableau',        'Power BI', 'Qubole', 'Delta Lake', 'MS Excel', 'SAP'\]

B:

has keywords related to any of the data programming languages mentioned in the job description (Python, R, SQL)

C:

has the ""data"" keyword mentioned in the job description

With those exclusions in place, the number of ""Proper"" Analysts in indexed jobs drops from  52,738 to 44,860. If you don't include (C), the number drops to 35,960.

I think it is valid to say that the main conclusion (that Analysts constitute the vast majority of the data job market) is defended.

Does working in a large corporation ever get less depressing and more interesting?,13y6m9f,"After almost 5 years spent in research (I have a MSc in Physics)  I was just annoyed to use my time in order to produce results that would eventually end up in a research paper to be forgotten after a few months: I didn't see any purpose in that. That's why in 2019 I moved to the industry by applying as Data Scientist to a large corporation. I really hoped the industry would give me more practical applications of my knowledge; I was wrong.

Since I joined the company I've been bouncing back and forth between different projects where I would have plenty of meetings discussing general stuff, without ever going into the details. Every time we were getting to something concrete it was said that I shouldn't do any development, as this is the task of subcontractors. Even when I managed to build some products that I think were pretty cool, after just a few months the same products ended up forgotten into a drawer because were built with already outdated requirements (a management issue). 

Nowadays I just spend my days working on personal projects as the tasks that I'm assigned to are fairly easy and don't require me too much time. Plus, I'm working on stuff that I'm pretty sure nobody will ever use. Why do I know that? I could be literally gone for days and almost nobody would realize. I shouldn't really complain as I'm not working many hours and payed more than enough, but being constantly without motivation is definitely not good...

Discussion about the sub,15fcchn,"Hello, y'all. I've been wanting to address this question for some time now. The sub is slowly changing to r/learndatascience. We get the same questions posted here everyday (sometimes several times on the same day):

1. What degree should I get?
2. How much math should I learn to work with DS?
3. How can I get the first job?
4. Will IA replace DS jobs?
5. Now and then also there are the ""I don't like math, how can I work with DS"", or the ""do I really need to learn advanced math?"" where by advanced math people mean linear algebra and calculus.

I understand that these are honest questions, but they have been already asked billions of times. Also, it is kind of astounding how people want to work with a technical field, hence you need to be constantly learning things and searching for answers, and yet they don't even bother to search if the same question was already asked on the sub. I mean, this is not even hard to do, you don't even have to be on reddit, just post on google reddit + question and google will show the it.

In my opinion this is bad for the sub as an online forum. Compare, e.g., with stackexchange. If a question was already asked people will shut it as duplicate and link to the previous post where it was already answered. This is bad, imo, because, it floods the sub and prevents people from having good discussions about the topic of the sub. I mean, it is quite some time that I don't see a real DS post here.

I know that it can sound like a rant, but I understand r/datascience as a forum where people go to talk about DS and honestly I miss seeing these posts, e.g., people talking about how they solved some particular problem, talking about research papers and etc.

And last but not least, I know that DS was hyped and people think that it is the new ""dev"" job to get easy money. But I think that discuss this topic we would be better suited with a post just to address it.

“I would have benefited more with an MBA than a MS stats”,14f6g5p,"This is a discussion I had with a relative of mine. She’s got her MS stats long ago and started working on modeling teams in various financial organizations, before she became one at a very reputable financial organization now. Soon, she said she got bored of building logistic regression models and moved to the analytics side, because she wanted to be more “business oriented”. She said that she liked it  more because it was more than just modeling, it was actually a leadership position.

When I asked her if her MS stats background was a valuable in asset in her analytics strategy role, she said that in fact, no it was the opposite, and she said she didn’t get respect from any higher ups for having a technical background. She feels she could have accelerated quicker due to an MBA, rather than a MS in statistics.

Is this something you guys are experiencing? Are there MBAs in data science now? Are MBAs really getting the nod nowadays in leadership roles? Even more so than good technical people? I’ve always had a negative opinion of MBAs, but, I’d like to hear from you all.

A Comparative Sentiment Analysis of Quran and Bible,13ndu1d,"Abstract:  
This project presents a comparative sentiment analysis of the Quran and Bible, using a bag-of-words approach and the NRC lexicon. **It is important to note that the analysis conducted has no validity in a religious context, and it was not intended to make any statements or draw conclusions related to religions or controversial matters.** The objective of this project was to explore the sentiment distribution and identify commonalities in language usage between these texts.

Methodology:  
The project involved data preprocessing, including text cleaning and transformation into a bag-of-words representation. The NRC lexicon, a widely used sentiment lexicon, was employed to assign sentiment categories to the words. Due to the availability of English translations, the analysis was limited to the English versions of the texts.

&#x200B;

Flaws and Limitations:  
Two notable flaws should be acknowledged in this project. Firstly, the sentiment analysis was conducted on English translations of the Quran and Bible. This introduces a potential limitation, as nuances of sentiment expression in the original languages might not be fully captured. Further studies analyzing the sentiment of the texts in their original languages are warranted for a comprehensive analysis.

Additionally, the sizes of the Quran and Bible significantly differ, with the Bible being much larger. While this could introduce bias in sentiment distribution due to varying amounts of text, it is intriguing to note that despite this difference, the percentages of sentiments exhibited in both texts were remarkably similar. This observation highlights the potential universality of sentiment expression in religious texts, independent of their size or specific content.

Would you agree? Focusing on mastering math is the best RoI for long-term satisfaction,1aq6sxh,"First of all, this is from the perspective of an analyst who is more on the business side, so let me know if I'm completely stupid.

Why I'm writing this - I think many people underestimate the basic ""boring"" math and they just go right to how neural networks function or how to use logistic regression

Algorithms keep changing, libraries keep changing, domain related knowledge will (partially) change as your economy sector evolves and you'll pick it up as you go anyway...

Even whatever university degree you pick is kind of arbitrary, some of them might make learning math easier for you, but you can always pick it up yourself - even if you study something seemingly unrelated, if you're smart enough for data science you can self-study math

If you're worried about long-term job prospects and satisfaction, it seems to me you should focus on making your main goal to master all possible areas of math. Even the ones directly unrelated to your work. Because data science (and tech in general) is a lifelong study and you will keep having to learn new stuff all the time.

But if you know the fundamental math behind it all, it will make it much easier to learn new algorithms for example. It will also be easier to pick up the logic behind certain principles within your domain, as you'll get better intuition. Part of this should be learning logic (whether you count this as math or philosophy is up to debate).

I am just thinking out loud and kind of looking for confirmation bias, because I've been learning all the juicy ML algorithms and libraries, programming languages etc in the past few years. And I'm thinking I should have just focused on getting better at statistics, probability, combinatorics, discrete math in general... linear algebra... calculus... hell, even if you go all the way back to elementary school or high school, there are surely some topics you forgot and they might be useful to re-learn (like some stuff from geometry that you NEVER used but it could be the missing piece from understanding some stuff you're working on now).

Because all the stuff I learned a few years ago is already obsolete anyway. But math is unchanged for hundreds and thousands of years. And still useful.

So recently I've more shifted to the theoretical side of things. And it's made me happier with problem solving and I have less impostor syndrome. All kinds of different word problems are good practice especially.

tldr: Instead of learning 50 ways to do similar things, learning the underlying math - not superficially, but all the way to the fundamentals, even all the way to elementary school if you forgot something - should be better for long-term.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1aq6sxh/would_you_agree_focusing_on_mastering_math_is_the/,JabClotVanDamn,168,Discussion,118,Top - year
I feel like I'm not good enough to find work,150llbm,"

Got laid off a couple months ago because of a reorg in the company. I live in Georgia and I have 5 years of experience as business/data analyst. Screened my resume, put action verbs, metrics, and $ amounts of revenue generated as a result. Used GPT to improve it several times, and friend who is a resume writer. So it's a damn good resume. But weeks now can't find a job as a data or business analyst. 500+ applicants for the jobs I've applied to so competition is high. Atlanta is just insane. Soooo much competition

"Should we use non-linear models for ""linear"" data?",172gy7a,"So I had an argument with an interviewer who asked me why I didn't just use a non-linear classification model on the linearly separable data that I had in one of my projects that I described to him, even though I had no computational constraints. I told him that it was because, irrespective of computational cost, a linear model is always preferable if you have linear data because it is simpler and captures general pattern while non-linear models might overfit on  local patterns. But he kept disagreeing and saying that the only advantage that a linear model would have is computational cost and explainability even though I was actually getting better results with a logistic regression.

Why so many data scientist complain about their work in this sub?,16bs1bd,"New in the field but extensive experience in statistics and business (20+ years PhD). 
My take is that being discouraged by what you actually get to do at work vs what you thought you were going to do is not something particular to Data Science. 

Many many other fields have the same situation, specially those of social sciences with some sort of math involved imo. 

My suggestion: adapt/change or find somewhere else where to work where the path is more to your expectations.

"Data science is not for me, is it?",16k5vah,"I have 2.5 years of experience as a data scientist and have held two different positions. Prior to this, I was a PhD student in Physics, specializing in Cosmoloy. In my PhD, I truly enjoyed the programming part a lot. Developing codes, understanding the numerical methods, and see the final results that came out of my codes was very rewarding. I felt like a pro.

During my PhD I had a summer course about ML/DL and I enjoyed the mathematics behind it and that made me think that a job as data scientist would be a good choice.


However, I'm beginning to question if this was the right choice. I won't delve into the specifics of my job experiences, but in one role, I used CNNs to detect defects in images. Surprisingly, a simple pre-trained model with some fine-tuning proved sufficient, making the work less challenging than expected 😅. I left that position before deploying the model for monetary reasons.


In my current job, I've spent the last five months mainly engaging with stakeholders, without much technical work. We're still in the planning phase, figuring out how to collect and extract data from machines in a factory environment. Oftentimes, we encounter resistance from suppliers who are reluctant to share information. I'm starting to feel very dependent on external factors that I can't control.


I really miss coding and translating mathematical problems into programming solutions, which makes me wonder if a career in software engineering might be more suitable for me.

Lessons From my 2 Year Job Search,170jlh2,"I just wanted to share some insights from my lengthy job hunt that recently ended on a somewhat positive note. If this resonates with people, I might expand it into a Medium article. My aim is to discuss my experiences, help others, and encourage debate to refine these ideas. I've already applied these learnings to help friends land decent jobs, so I hope it helps you too. This is particularly aimed at those starting their careers in data.

A bit about me: I have 7 years of statistics education and a Master's from a reputable U.S. public school. Graduated amid COVID, I became a model & bottle promoter in Europe while freelancing as a data scientist/analyst. Landed a corperate Data Analyst role last month.

1: Experience Over Education

Your education should solely be a stepping stone to gain experience, be it through internships, entry-level positions, or research. Don't overestimate the power of theoretical knowledge; practical experience reigns supreme. Grades only serve as a ticket to initial experiences.

2 and 3: Refer to Point 1

4: Understanding HR/Recruiters

When writing your resume or preparing for interviews, keep it simple but impactful. Recruiters skim through resumes, so your accomplishments should stand out and be quantifiable. Misrepresenting numbers isn't advisable but emphasizing impact is.

5: Always Be Active

If you're job-hunting, always have a project in the works. Freelance gigs are relatively easy to find, and they add valuable experience to your resume. Keep records of your work—publish articles, maintain a GitHub repository, or hold onto contracts.

6: Networking and Luck

Networking is crucial, and often it's not about what you know but who you know. Being at the right place at the right time can spell success. Lack of social skills will be a bottleneck to career growth even when technical skills are stellar.

7: Company Culture vs Reality

Companies may claim to value innovation and talent, but what they're really looking for are reliable candidates who won't mess up. They're impressed by practical business experience, not academic projects or grades. Phrases like ""innovative culture"", ""entrepreneurial"",  ""solving the largest problems"", ""looking for the most talented people"", etc. are all lies especially for starting out.

8: Avoid Targeting Remote Jobs

Targeting only remote jobs was my biggest mistake. Remote positions usually require a significant amount of experience, so aim for local opportunities or consider relocating.

Final Words
Always prioritize your needs over the company's. Don't shy away from promoting yourself or taking new offers even at the last minute. Most companies are self-centered, and as an employee, you should adopt the same approach to your advantage.

Hope this helps, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/170jlh2/lessons_from_my_2_year_job_search/,LeaguePrototype,159,Discussion,39,Top - year

The future of coding in data analytics,17zgu1a,"Like a lot of people who studied data science, i spend a lot more of my career looking at analytics, reporting and visualisation these days - lets face it, thats where the bulk of the value and jobs are in most industries.

I spend my first few years working in teams that used R (mostly) or Python. And SQL, obviously. Basically understanding and investigating stuff was done in SQL, visualisation, dashboards, packs were done in R (shout out to ggplot2).

I now work in consulting, where i get to see a lot of industry analytics teams and a lot of the analytics teams i work with these days are ""no code"" teams.

These teams use click and drag tools for ETL, analytics, visualisation and reporting (qlikview, dataiku, power bi, sas EG, alteryx, informatica). There are entire analytics and even engineering functionalities within some companies where noone can code.

Now these tools are expensive as hell - but they are time efficient, reduce a lot of IT risk around data access, and limit the amount of fuckery a single rogue idiot can wreak.

My question is, as these tools become more entrenched in major organisations is there any role for analysts that can code?

To be honest, im biased - i love coding, so i want to believe there is a future for it. But also dont want to bury my head in the sand either, if coding is going the way of the typewriter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17zgu1a/the_future_of_coding_in_data_analytics/,None,152,Discussion,54,Top - year

İn my job market, unfortunately, most data scientists are self-taught or bootcamp graduates, so, employers don't require degrees really. But, the lack of formal relevant education really makes me doubtful, insecure and frustrated actually about my future. As I'd like to work remotely or relocate (to Europe), I'm feeling really insecure. DS in US/EU seems very overspecialized, with everyone in the industry having PhDs, being wizards of stats, etc. In this subreddit I've also seen a lot of people talking about the need of solid math/stats foundation, or just forget about DS. 

Is it true? Do I need to spend 1-2 years figuring out math/stats on my own somehow (still without degree) to get a decent job? It feels quiete overwhelming and hard to be honest. I really love technical part of the job (coding in general, deployment, building pipelines, etc), but the theoretical part really haunts me. Should I look for something more software related like data/mlops engineering instead? I'm really feeling overwhelmed and lost here, any advice would be great.

Should I accept given the current state of the job market? Or should I decline and search for a higher-paying opportunity later?

Reflecting on the Changing Hiring Bar,12l8o0k,"I'm curious to hear your experiences on how the hiring bar has changed, especially for those that have been in the field 5+ years.

From a purely anecdotal perspective, it feels that the hiring bar for data scientists has gone up and is all over the place. I might be wrong, but it felt that 5 years ago if you knew A/B testing + jupyter notebooks it was good enough.

Disclaimer: there's no one definitive definition of what a data scientist is, so each company/field will have different criteria. Obviously you can't thoroughly test for everything, sometimes it's just a ""Can you tell me what X is and how it's used?"".

These are the interview elements where I feel the bar has gone up:

* More leetcode medium, DS/ML coding level is moving closer to SWE. Definitely ran into some leetcode hards. 
* MLE leaning roles will ask for knowledge on how to productize DS projects. Knowledge of AWS and containers is sort of expected.
* DS roles expect at least some idea of how neural networks work, sometimes how transformers work.

What has not changed and will probably remain the same:

* SQL still very relevant, not much change in difficulty.
* Classification metrics.
* Ability to translate business problems into DS action items.

"Learning Python and R at the same time - Pros and Cons, and Do's and Don'ts",1bjndue,"EDIT: Thank you for all the amazing insights so far!

Hi all,

The question is for those who have experience with this. I like to have one as a main language and the other as the sidekick. For now I seem to have chosen for Python for several reasons, more courses and tutorials, more articles, larger community. However, R and by extension RStudio/Posit, somehow has a huge attraction to me. Maybe it's their lively Youtube channel, great looking website, ... they just seem to be out there.

I installed both, tried both, chose Python as my main focus. At least once a week RStudio is calling me so I launch it and click around (I like Quarto too btw). But the more I learn Python, the more I find R code to be weird.

In the end I just need to try learning both to find out if it's going to work out, but I like to ask the community first so I can start from a sort of baseline on those with experience in learning them at the same time.

What are the pros and cons, do's and don'ts? Did you basically do everything twice, once in Py and once in R? Or use them for different things, perhaps EDA in R, but then move to Py for ML (or vice versa)? Would that be a good way to learn both, or even make it more complicated?

A bit of background info, I'm learning this in my spare time, neither is used at my current job. Looking at job descriptions on my side of the world, the most asked of the two is Python, some ask for R, some ask for R as a second, and a few stated that either is fine. To me learning a second has merit and potential purpose.

Why employers want experience over education,179ebar,"**Creativity**: We often focus a lot on hard skills, but creativity is the most important attribute for a data scientist. You will get some crazy requests. For example, I was once asked to build a recommendation system with NO DATA. Many other data scientists dismissed the project saying it couldn't be done. I was able to accomplish it by building a simple model were I manually entered weights depending on how important I thought each feature was. I then set up a pipeline to update these weights as real data would come in. Was it perfect? No. But it did a good enough job while we were waiting for data and made the client happy. I have had many crazy requests like this. So many data scientists out there have to be told what to do, very few can come up with creative solutions. The best never use phrases like, ""that is impossible."" How do you learn this creativity? By working on real world problems. This skill is not developed when you are given a toy dataset and told what the output should look like. Sure, you might learn some technical modeling, but virtually no creativity. I wish more bootcamps would give ""impossible"" tasks.

**Dirty Data**: I understand that provided or toy datasets can sometimes be dirty. They don't come close to real world data. Imagine you are asked to build a model using datasets you do not know exist yet, coming from source systems with little-to-no descriptions of what the features mean. Somehow you need to find the right data in a sea of millions of irrelevant features. You will need to fight political battles to even get access to the features you do not yet know if you even need. You will need to track down knowledgeable people who can tell you the weird quirks in the data (e.g. missing months were poorly imputed when this random country suffered a natural disaster 12 years ago). You then need to build a full pipeline that pulls the data from 10 different data sources that don't link to each other naturally, do regression tests because they don't update consistently, transform it, do feature engineering, feed it to a model, monitor the model for drift, redo everything after you find out a feature is completely different from what you were told, and the list goes on. This is not an exaggeration, it is typical. It goes way beyond cleaning up a few outliers and training a prototype model. This experience can only be gained by doing it.

**Being easy to work with**: A bad hire can be a disaster! One person can ruin group moral and be difficult to get rid of. It can be difficult to judge personality from a few interviews. Haveing work experience where you got along with the same team for years greatly reduces that risk.

There are many others, but these are three big ones. If you don't have these skillsets, that is fine! But you have to start smaller. Get a more Jr level position where you are not expected to know all of these. Get experience working on them with more senior mentors. Even if you are one of the lucky few who get a job out of college in this market, your manager is probably clueless of these issues (i.e. won't be able to help you) and setting you up for failure. Many on this sub are looking for shortcuts or complaining about their job after they took a shortcut. You will have a much better career if you take the patient route.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/179ebar/why_employers_want_experience_over_education/,Expendable_0,148,Discussion,79,Top - year

Is imposter syndrome in data analytics/science common?,18z0sbu,"I’m [M27] currently a Senior Data Analyst in the public sector in the UK. My background was a Physics degree, Physics PhD (involving data analysis), a 2 year stint as a Junior Data Analyst after that, and I recently landed my Senior role.

Despite it going very well for me on paper (and in practice - I have never had any performance concerns raised, and have been praised for my work) I constantly feel like I’m not good enough. It feels like there’s always just *too much* to know and remember, whether it be different programming languages or mathematical/statistical approaches. You’ve got programming languages like SQL, R, Python, tools like Excel and Power BI, version control platforms like GitHub, and that’s before you get into the world of statistics and statistical techniques (descriptive stats, inferential stats, predictive modelling, etc.), and data visualisation. And this is even before you have to get to grips with the datasets you’re working with and the wider context.

The problem is, it just seems impossible to know and retain all this information, especially when I’m not using it all daily - yet I put this pressure on myself to be a fountain of knowledge for all things data analysis because you’re supposed to “gain experience and develop” throughout your career. So why do I feel like I’m actively getting worse and forgetting things every day? I basically feel like “me of yesterday” was sharper/cleverer than the “me of today”.

Are these normal thoughts? 

Part of me wonders if it’s due to my background being physics (also forgotten most of that now despite doing 7 years of it), and not directly statistics, or do people in other technical fields with relevant backgrounds have these thoughts too?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/18z0sbu/is_imposter_syndrome_in_data_analyticsscience/,JLane1996,144,Career Discussion,67,Top - year
ChatGPT becomes a serious contender for exploratory data analysis,17t04cn,"You likely heard about the recent ChatGPT updates with the possibility to create assistants (aka GPTs) with code generation and interpretation capacities. One of the GPTs provided with this update by OpenAI is a Data Analysis assistant, showing the company already identified this area as a strong application for its tech.

Just by providing a dataset you can start generating some simple or more advanced visualisations, including those needing some data processing or aggregations. This means anyone can interact with a dataset just using plain English.

If you're curious (and have a ChatGPT+ subscription) you can play with this [GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5CQsMRvyT-international-football-explorer) I created to explore a dataset on International Football Games (aka soccer ;) ).

What makes it strong:

* Interact in simple English, no coding required
* Long context: you can iterate on a plot or analysis as chatGPT keeps memory of the past context
* Capacity to generate plots or run some data processing thanks to its capacity to write and execute Python code.
* You can use ChatGPT's ""knowledge"" to comment on what you observe and give you some hints on trends you observe

I'm personally quite impressed, the results are most of the time correct (you can check the code it generated). Provided the tech was only released a year ago, this is very promising and I can easily imagine such natural language interface being implemented in traditional BI platforms like Tableau or Looker.

It is of course not perfect and we should be cautious when using it. Here are some caveats:

* It struggles with more advanced requests like creating a model. It usually needs mulitple iteration and some technical guidance (e.g. indicating which model to choose) to get to a reasonable result.
* It can make some mistakes that you won't catch unless you have a good understanding of the dataset or check the code (e.g. at some point it ran an analysis on a subset that it generated for a previous analysis while I wanted to run it on the whole dataset). You need to be extra careful with the instructions you give it and double checking the results
* You need to manually upload the datasets for now, which makes non-technical persons still dependent on someone to pull the data for them. Integration with external databases or external apps connected to multiple APIs will soon come to fix that, it is only an integration issue.

It will definitely not take our jobs tomorrow but it will make business stakeholders less reliant on technical persons and might slightly reduce the need for data analysts (the same way tools like Midjourney reduce a bit the dependence on artists for some specific tasks, or ChatGPT for Copywriters).

Below are some examples of how you can easily require for a plot to be created with a first interpretation.

Getting a Data science degree while working full time. Am I just fucked?,16fh6pg,"Hello Reddit.

So long story short, I was an economics major in undergrad, then graduated in 2020. We all know what happened in 2020. So eventually I got a job at a university and entered a data science MS program.

The thing is because I'm also working full time  (which pays my tuition), I'm unable to do internships and don't have time to pick up side projects. I have some other skills and had one decent internship in undergrad, but my current position is unrelated to data science. 

Seeing the way people describe the job market here, am I just fucked? It seems like even with internships and side projects it takes people months to get entry level Data Analysis positions. The only solution I could imagine would be quitting my job to study full time and find an internship, but I don't even know if I could get one, plus I'd have to pay for school AND I'd lose my safety net.

Red flags include:

* No data / inaccessible data / data flying around in Excel
* Management is not ""ML literate""
* More work dealing with red tape than actual work
* 2x more managers than workers driving projects
* Business consumers of our ML output do not trust it, and do not want it. They only like linear regression because they understand it
* No version control. We run everything manually in prod. There is no dev/qa/prod separation. There is no deployment. There is no automation.
* Because we work directly in prod, we don't have permission to save our processed data to tables or csv's - it must be done in memory every single day
* No access to basic tools of the trade. We had to beg for basic file storage (s3) for 9 weeks. We can't download unapproved libraries or pre-trained models without security review (even just for exploration)

Haven't had any real work for the last 2 years at 2 different companies,12li3r3,"I graduated May 2021 and started working as a Data Scientist at General Motors. I was given a project but there was no project manager, customer, deadline or anything. I held myself accountable for 5 months setting my own deadlines etc until I realized that this just wasn't a real project and the company was terribly mismanaged. I took initiative to find other projects and each project I got just kept getting canceled or there wasn't any data.

Then I switched to a Solutions Data Scientist role July 2022 at a larger tech company last year. I spent the first 3 months in training (completely irrelevant to Data Science) and then had absolutely no work. I networked like crazy and got a project on another team last fall which was somewhat exciting but this year there has been absolutely nothing. The other teams seem to have work but they won't let me on to even shadow because they want to prioritize utilization for their employees. My team has no data science work or data to play with. The Solutions Data Scientist role is weird because it is client-facing so if the clients don't want to engage, there is no work. Another challenge is that even when the clients engage, our priority is selling the company's AI products so there is minimal actual data science involved.

I'm kind of concerned that I'm going to end up with years of Data Science experience with nothing to show for it. What should I do?

Twitter's For You Recommendation Algorithm,12gp6d3,"Twitter open-sourcing a majority of its recommendation algorithm offers an exciting opportunity for researchers, industry practitioners, and RecSys enthusiasts to closely examine how Twitter computes the recommended feed for the For You page.

[Twitter's announcement](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/a-new-era-of-transparency-for-twitter) | [Main GitHub Repo](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/) | [ML GitHub Repo](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml) | [Engineering Blog Post](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/open-source/2023/twitter-recommendation-algorithm)

TL;DR:

**Candidate Generation**

* For You Feed has an equal split for in-network tweets and out-of-network tweets.
* In-network tweets are sourced using a logistic regression on features derived from Twitter's RealGraph framework (batch-updated daily).
   *  Twitter also mentioned that the logistic regression model was trained several years ago and is being redesigned. 
* Some out-of-network tweets are sourced from 2 types of random walks over a real-time, in-memory, bipartite graph based on the GraphJet engine. While the majority is sourced from SimClusters in latent embedding space.
* Pretrained Heterogeneous Information Network (TwHIN) embeddings are used for multiple downstream tasks including candidate generation and ranking.

**Ranking**

* Early ranking is done in EarlyBird using a logistic regression model.
   * Twitter notes that “*the current model was last trained several years ago, and uses some very strange features.*” and they are working on training a new model. 
* A Parallel MaskNet (originally proposed by Weibo) is used as the heavy ranker.

**Heuristics and Filtering**

* Out-of-network competitor URLs and out-of-network tweets without second-degree connection are removed.
* Blue verified accounts are boosted by a factor of 2 or 4 (out-of-network vs in-network).

**Mixing**

* Ads, promotions, and follow recommendations are blended into the feed.

Twitter also released a lot of artifacts like the associated code, model configs, hyperparameters, input feature descriptions, feature weights, combined score calculation formulas, etc. that are immensely valuable for ML practitioners.

How do you avoid p-hacking?,17m2b07,"We've set up a Pre-Post Test model using the [Causal Impact](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html) package in R, which basically works like this:

* The user feeds it a target and covariates
* The model uses the covariates to predict the target
* It uses the residuals in the post-test period to measure the effect of the change

Great -- except that I'm coming to a challenge I have again and again with statistical models, which is that tiny changes to the model completely change the results.

We are training the models on earlier data and checking the RMSE to ensure goodness of fit before using it on the actual test data, but I can use two models with near-identical RMSEs and have one test be positive and the other be negative.

The conventional wisdom I've always been told was not to peek at your data and not to tweak it once you've run the test, but that feels incorrect to me. My instinct is that, if you tweak your model slightly and get a different result, it's a good indicator that your results are not reproducible.

So I'm curious how other people handle this. I've been considering setting up the model to identify 5 settings with low RMSEs, run them all, and check for consistency of results, but that might be a bit drastic.

Moving from a SQL Monkey role into an ML Engineering role,15bx5ff,"I know, I know, this sub thinks of getting into a well-paid SQL monkey role as winning a lottery.

My problem is that the higher-ups saw me as the most talented SQL monkey on the team, and ""promoted"" me into a team lead role where I now have to manage 10 other SQL monkeys, and regularly interact with lots of unpleasant people in the company. I have lasted for a couple of years but honestly I just can't take it anymore. Way too much stress and way too little technical challenge.

So I've made up my mind to leave, but I figured the chances of me finding another SQL monkey job that would pay as well are pretty slim (I'm in Europe). Everyone is saying the real money is in Engineering.

**Has anyone ever made a successful transition from a SQL monkey role into an ML engineering role? Can you give me any advice on what to prepare for, what to watch out for, and how to best sell myself?**

My biggest concern is that after 2 years of being a SQL monkey - followed by 2 years of managing other SQL monkeys - I have very little to show. I haven't shipped a single ML model to prod in the last 5 years, and I have no idea where I'd even start in a ML system design interview because... well, my company didn't give me a single opportunity to design ML systems at scale.

At the same time I don't think I am a Junior engineer - my Python / ML fundamentals are still strong,  and after two years in management I think it's fair to say I have very solid soft / leadership skills too. I just don't want to stay on the management track anymore.

Do I stand a chance getting into ML engineering roles in the current market?

Is it wrong to be wanting to stay mediocre?,16kc2hi,"I am just over 1 year into my role as a Data Analyst.

Due to my inexperience, I am usually working on some of the more mundane and boring tasks. I did try to go above and beyond, and took on tasks that became extra learning for me. These types of works took me weeks to go through. Not only was my effort not appreciated other than the usual ""Thanks!"" or ""Great work!"", it sometimes didn't even make it to the final modeling.

There are also times when the database gets a hiccup and takes days for admins to fix it, times when the raw data doesn't have all the info we're looking for, or things that are just beyond my control. I feel so frustrated with these type of problems because I really can't do anything about it other than keep saying ""Waiting for the the issue to be resolved"" on the team update.

I really was looking forward to using this job as an opportunity to sharpen my skills in data professionalism, but I don't see the merit. It also doesn't help the fact that most of the work I do is global health-related topics, something that I came to not care about.

Maybe I am just working for the wrong industry, but I don't think I care if I don't get a promotion and pay increase; If I am not enjoying my work on top of my work not being appreciated, I just don't see any reason to try harder.

Thanks for the responses. It made me think about what I want to be doing in the near future. I do like the work I’m doing, but maybe I am just not in the right industry? I also feel the exact nature of my work is somewhat different from what is typically expected in a DA role.

I don’t mind having lots to do, but I want see progress made. If I’m stuck on things that are beyond my control, I start to feel disdain in what I’m doing.

I will be starting a master’s program soon that will help me strengthen my skills. With it I’m hoping to be DA for other industries because i will have a few years of experience by then.

Update half a year into my first data science job...,18ylba9,"As with the title, I started my first data science job about seven months ago and I wanted to share my experience for anyone considering getting into the field.

It has been amazing so far! For the first time in my life, I can honestly say that I love my job.

I'm a fully remote Data Scientist working for a big research university, and it's the best working experience I've ever had. My boss is super chill, always looking out for me, and makes sure I don't get overworked. They're also always encouraging me to use down time to keep learning, and to work on back burner projects that interest me and utilize all of my skills so I can keep sharp.

As for the work, I love getting to work with lots of data and to build/train models to provide actionable data insights and answer important questions - sometimes I feel like a detective. Further, I love my ""clients"" (university leadership), and they're always appreciative of my work (honestly, they seem to look at what I do like it's magic haha). I also feel like my work is actually useful and makes a difference for the university since it gets used in institution-wide decision making, accreditation, gets published on the website, etc.

I love that they don't care ""when"" I work as long as the work gets done (i.e., I can run errands mid morning if I feel like it, etc.) - there's a ton of freedom/autonomy. And I love statistics/numbers, and I feel like I get to be somewhat creative. I will say, however, I'm in lots of Zoom meetings that should maybe be emails lol, but it's sometimes nice just to get a chance to talk to people since we're remote (I kind of feel like that's what the meetings are for).

Finally, the pay and benefits are amazing. A lot of the time, I'm amazed by it lol (particularly since I came from a lower-paying, higher-workload and higher-stress field - clinical research - it's night and day).

So, how did I get into it? I'm doing my master's in DS and have a bachelor's degree in econometrics, but I also think the bulk of how I got the job was from doing projects and being able to show that I knew what I was doing via a portfolio/giving concrete examples of competency.

Change my mind: AI is inherently public domain knowledge and should not be commercialized,183uo20,"So I want to start out by saying that AI is an incredibly useful, arguably fundamental tool.  LLMs have an amazing potential to aid in productivity, I really feel that AI is going to make personalized healthcare a possibility and there are of course many as of yet undiscovered applications.  We need AI in our lives and it can make the world a better place.

But the scale of data required to train these things necessitates using publicly available data which no one can claim to have developed or collected themselves.  If a company has sales data and it trains AI on that data which they colected and organized, then yes they can claim this is an IP they themselves made and developed.  But we all know these models are of limited generalizability.  And when we think of training say an AI to predict which drug is going to treat a person cancer based on the genotyping of a tumor sample there is simply no way an private enterprise would be able to collect and collate the data needed for that sort of discovery.  It needs to be open access, you can commercialize certain aspects and applications I'm sure.  Like compounds discovered using the model, if you used it to develop those compounds.  But the core model needs to be not for profit and withholding that model past a certain point is harmful to society at large and unjust considering you didn't really build the thing yourself.

Looking forward to counter arguments, refinement of my logic, and healthy discussion.  Be civil lets have a fun talk if you have any thoughts!

**EDIT** ***I wanted to share something a very knowledgeable poster provided about what specific aspects of an LLM (or other advance ML) should be public and what should remain a companies IP.  It's very comprehensive and well thought through:***

>I think the entire set of training data (technically I mean the entire dataset and not in the sense of training, validation, test, or any other subset used for calibration) should be made available, even what is created in-house. I think it's very important that everyone at least have the same access to the data. My reasoning for that is because it is extremely important to ensure that dataset is not biased, which would take a lot of people with a lot of different perspectives to figure out. It also removes the major barrier to entry so hopefully people would focus on innovation, instead of obtaining data. That's it though. Everything else is the spawn of creativity and compute resources and opening them would serve no purpose beyond allowing replication of the product.  
>  
>The parameter weights are the product of the compute time, so once that expense gets high enough, IMO, it really seems like theft to force them to give it away. It would remove the incentive for anyone else to spend more time making a better product. The structure of the models, the order the functions are called, even the way the training data is applied can all make a big difference in performance. So I see that as a creative work requiring a lot of effort which also shouldn't be given away. If the models are only using techniques developed in academia, then anyone can learn those regardless of whether or not any specific company makes their models public (spoiler: they aren't).  
>  
>I would also be supportive of making it a requirement to provide no-cost API access for watchdogs or organizations to ensure an unbiased final model. Like an audit of the final product.

"Working as a Data Scientist, what can I do to not lose my software engineering skills?",168309k,"Hello. I'm data professional with one and half year experience who spent 5 years working as a software engineer before that. At first my work in data was mostly MLE, so I used to make a lot of coding 

However in the last 6 months I realized I'm no longer doing any engineering job and now mostly create queries and some data pipelines with Spark and most of my work is data analysis, statistical testing and modeling. Also spend a lot of time discussing with business team and designers to try to figure out how to turn my insights in new features 

I do like my job and I don't see myself coming back to engineering for at least more 2 years. 

However I'm afraid I can lose some of my software engineering skills because I no longer code proper software, only small bits of data.

Has anybody played with Astrological sign as a feature?,1ahj1gj,"Now that I've got your attention.

Astrology, while largely a pseudoscience that appeals to non data minded folk, is largely about identifying trends and presenting them in a human readable (albeit unscientific) format.

While it's unlikely that the placement of the stars and planets themselves have a significant impact on the trajectory of an individual, the placing of their birthdate within the year (which I suppose is in relation to the sun) probably has an impact on how they develop and find their way within society.

For example, someone born in August tends to start school almost a year earlier in their development than an individual born in September. From there the August child will always be amongst the youngest in their class whereas the September child is grouped with the oldest. This has cascading effects throughout childhood development that will leave drastically different imprints upon both children and create different adult life paths.

So now that I've gone through that long winded explanation to justify my buzzy title, does anybody have experience playing with birthdate (specifically time of year, as opposed to age) as a feature?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ahj1gj/has_anybody_played_with_astrological_sign_as_a/,ALonelyPlatypus,122,Discussion,48,Top - year

Which path is better: Data Science or Software Engineering?,1adt52s,"Okay, so I'm in need of some career advice, because honestly I'm at a point where I don't really know how to proceed in the future.

For some background info:
- I've completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (3 years degree), took a year of pause (during that time I just focused on work), and at the moment I'm in my first year (out of 2) of my Masters's degree in Data Science.

- As for work experience, I started working during my second year of Bachelor's as a Software Engineer. I've completed two internships, and I've been a Junior Software Engineer for more than a year and a half (currently I'm still working, trying to manage both my job and the university lectures and assignments in parallel). The languages/frameworks that I've worked with the most are Python - Django/FatsAPI, Ruby - Ruby on Rails, TypeScript - React (even if my perspective for this field is that I shouldn't be fixed on just some languages/standards, as the industry is evolving at such a rate, that from a month to the other we might find a new tool that's 100 times more efficient).

- Up until recently I didn't ever interact that much with the concepts of Machine Learning, but since starting the Data Science degree I've realised that I like this field a lot and I take every Uni project as a challenge that I love solving.

Now let's get to the actual issue at hand: in the next few months I would like to look for another workplace, since I've realized that the environment that I'm currently in is affecting me negatively and unfortunately I don't consider that this is a place where I can grow (both as an employee/software engineer as well as a person in general). If you'd like more info about the reasons, I can edit this post and add them, but I don't want to make this too long.

At this point, I don't really know what path to take: continue with the Software Engineering career or switch to Data Science / ML / NLP?

I'm asking this from 2 distinct perspectives:
1. which one of the two is better for my future? I've been reading different posts lately about some data scientists / ml engineers saying that this field is really volatile and a lot of companies switch strategies from one day to another and many find themselves unemployed out of the blue, besides the fact that some people say that there are already too many data scientists / ml engineers for the few jobs required. But thinking about all of the advances in AI that have been happening lately, I was under the impression that this field is going to thrive in the future.
2. I have always believed that salaries in both fields are good, but as a data scientist / ml engineer you can reach a higher max salary compared to what the max salary of a software engineer can be (even if I've also read posts that stated the contrary).

If I want to be completely honest, I think that I already have the answer, since I like a lot what I'm studying and everything related to this field is just sooo captivating. 

But my problem right now is that I've ve been able to get to a point where I'm competent enough as a software engineer to make enough money to support myself, so finding another job in the same field would be easier. Since my parents are not helping me financially anymore, I don't think I would be able to get by with the paycheck of an intern (around 800 Euros/month where I live), if I were to switch fields.
And I don't think anyone would take me in this field for anything more than an internship, because I'm aware of the fact that I do not have enough experience in Machine Learning and Statistics for any other role.

As for some additional information that might be helpful, I'm in my early twenties and I live in Eastern Europe, where prices are not as high as in other places, but it's still not easy to get by by yourself.
I've been also looking around for various opportunities in other countries in this field, in order to be able to work remotely or maybe do an internship there, but I haven't been able to find much.

PS: I know that a lot of people might say that I'm young and that this is the best time to take risks, but going to an intern's salary would just expose me to the risk of being homeless, and that's not such a good option :D

PS 2.0: I have also mentioned the NLP sector because it sparked my interest and I’ve been taking some extra classes in order to gain some more knowledge about it.

How do data scientist managers manage data scientists?,172zdgx,"As a data science manager how do you manage your team? Specifically how do you manage your DSs career growth and promotion opportunities? Imagine you have a team of 5 DSs: 2 DS1, 2 DS2, and 1 DS3, where DSX is a Data Scientist 1-4. What is your measure of success - promotions, completed projects, revenue contribution,etc? How do DSX become DSX+1?

Some of my thoughts:

1. As a manager, I can support my DSs by **NOT** micromanaging.  I will track your project and encourage model reviews, code reviews and present final outputs to the team. All necessary skills of a DS.

2. I can ensure my DSs have the skills to mange a project. A DS1 would see many touch points with the manager(me) or a DS3-4 on projects to ensure success, a DS2 less, and DS3 probably none. This in fact is my basis for promotion - shows level of competency on managing projects and deliverables. 

3. There can also be project based performance promotion, that is, DS possibly lacking project managing skills but tackles difficult projects and delivers top notch work consistently. 

4. The bigger issue is about personal development(PD).  How do managers balance PD against available projects? The DSs may want to gain experience in applying AI or unstructured learning , GPGPU models, specific toolsets like Vertex AI, NLP etc. Your team’s project assignments  may not see this diverse a set of projects. When a project becomes available I balance availability against skill set in order to complete the projects based on delivery times and quarterly goals because these are the measures of success for my team. Typically I fill the void with targeted training courses and allocate time to PD. 

5. Some managers think PD is solely the DS’s responsibility. Thoughts?

6. How do you deal with HR when there are no clear DS role descriptions?

Background story: This semester I'm taking a machine learning class and noticed some aspects of the course were a bit odd.

1. Roughly a third of the class is about logic-based AI, problog, and some niche techniques that are either seldom used or just outright outdated.
2. The teacher made a lot of bold assumptions (not taking into account potential distribution shifts, assuming computational resources are for free \[e.g. **Leave One Out Cross-Validation**\])
3. There was no mention of MLOps or what actually matters for machine learning in production.
4. Deep Learning models were outdated and presented as if though they were SOTA.
5. A lot of evaluation methods or techniques seem to make sense within a research or academic setting but are rather hard to use in the real world or are seldom asked by stakeholders.

(This is a biased opinion based off of 4 internships at various companies)

This is just one class but I'm just wondering if it's common for professors to have a biased opinion while teaching (favouring academic techniques and topics rather than what would be done in the industry)

How do you deal with people wanting definite answers when statistics isn't deterministic?,18d4sf5,"I'm sure you all know that nothing in statistics is certain, it's all probabilities and degrees of confidence.

The amount of times I've had to explain that correlation =/= causation, or why aggregate metrics based on very small sample sizes aren't reliable is insane. Like I get it's not their job to know stats and data science, but at some point these things should be common sense, and I shouldn't have to waste half a meeting explaining it for the 30th time.

And whenever I come back to them with some kind of result, I choose my words carefully, not to over promise, cause guess who's ass is on the line if I'm wrong. If I say ""increased advertising appears to be correlated with increased sales"", they hear ""spend more money on advertising"". They will then spend that money and if it doesn't work, I'm the one who apparently messed up.

I've been working around it by both choosing my words carefully and creating documentation. Kind of like a CYA, if they don't heed my warnings and it blows up in their faces, at least I can point back to them saying I told them. For the former, it's in one ear out the other, are increasingly happening in meetings where there is no official transcript I can point back to.

In my mind, my job is to tell them what I found and let them draw their own conclusions. I get that data science and stats aren't their job, but at the same job, sales isn't mine, so why am I making conclusions for sales people about what they should do?

How do you detect when a data scientist is chasing a wild goose? And how do you prevent them from consuming company resouces unnecessarily?,18y9xbd,"Some teams in my organization have empowered data scientists to explore and develop AI/ML use cases, which is a positive initiative, in the sense that data scientistsare now encouraged to engage more with cross functional data. However, we have noticed that this freedom has led to an experimentation spree, resulting in unnecessary expenses and resource allocation. The new data scientists, who joined our org after getting impacted by FAANG layoffs, are insisting on expensive software and cloud technologies that are straining our annual budget. 

This has caused some concern among the more experienced cross-functional data science teams, including mine, who believe that the leadership's generosity towards the new data scientists is misplaced. They strongly opine, although not openly, that the leadership should not be enamored by flashy yet generic AI-ML slide decks and ""data sciency"" quotes being thrown at them by these new age data scientists.  They feel that these inexperienced data scientists are pursuing impractical ideas that do not contribute to the business effectively. 

Additionally, the new data scientists seem uninterested to take-up any other analytical or engineering work apart from coding in  their Jupyter NBs. While it is important for data scientists to experiment, there needs to be a balance and clarity on when to focus and when to halt. Due to lack of data literacy among the leadership, we feel that there is a lack guidelines to prevent inexperienced data scientists from pursuing use cases that do not provide value to the business.

Top 5 things you dislike about your team / role / organization,17rrybm,"Figured we can rant a bit. 

For whatever reason, my team has recently hired a few unqualified MBAs to do management work in the data science space and honestly I think it was the biggest fuck up they've ever made. 

So here are the top 5 things I dislike:
1. Condescending micromanagers. It's not enough that you have daily standup, they want to bug you after lunch and before the day is over to get a ""status report"". Like bro fuck off this is data science not supply chain management. 
2. Too many middle managers (Incompetence meets big egos and we have a middle manager)
3. Daily standups. Most data science peojects are better suited for twice weekly check-ins with ad-hoc meetings between ICs as needed. 
4. General imbalance of management to individual contributors. Every project I've been on is like 8 business people and 2 data scientists and it's completely unnecessary. The data scientists do all of the work while the business people circle jerk strategy that doesn't make sense at all in the context of the data and we litterally have to show them why their idea doesn't make sense on every project multipled times, we're basically training them all over time and it's really unnecessary. 
5. I spend way too much time in meetings to be an IC data scientist. I spend 20 to 25 hours a week in meetings on average and I have to actively participate in all of them.... I could accomplish so much more if I had less BS meetings but that would also require having less BS middle managers, etc.

How many companies actually have a clear plan for their data?,179945p,"I have been working as a ""data scientist"" in supply chain for a little over a year at a fortune 500 company. I am the only person with a data related title on my team. There is one small team of people with ""data scientist"" titles in the whole org but they are in a separate silo from me. 

Generally I am tossed tasks that don't make a whole lot of sense: for example comparing forecast accuracy for the exact same models between a no-code out of the box forecaster like SAP IBP with Python models that a contractor they hired built. Other times I will get requests so vague like ""build us a chatbot"". I have always hounded them with questions and shared my opinions on these asks, but basically get told to shut up and go away each time.  

Now they have cut what I can only assume is a few million dollar check with a large consulting company to build out a demand and inventory forecasting model. The thing is, they just launched an out-of-the-box SAP solution less than 2 years ago which does exactly that: inventory and demand forecasting. I can't imagine that project was less than a few million as well. 

In all of this, no one can ever really articulate to me why we are doing this or what specifically they are trying to improve. It seems like they don't even realize the consultants will likely build a very similar model to SAP. 

Are most companies like this? Only some? It has been very stressful for me, as 4 people have also been let go from my team within the year I've worked here.

Hiring managers: is there a reason for an IC-level Data Analyst/Scientist to speak to every level of leadership?,14wzrt7,"I’ve been interviewing for DS and DA roles, none of whom are paying crazy $150K salaries, and I talk to at LEAST 6 people throughout the whole interview process, not including any take-homes or other assessments.

I ask because as lengthy as the interview process is, it only takes one person to say “no.” And quite frankly, the higher the position, the higher the ego, and it shows in the interviews. I had a VP of Marketing continuously interrupt me, and I’ve had one CMO who simply did not prepare. 

I’d get positive feedback from the Hiring Managers and peers, but then I speak to VP/C-levels and get completely thrown off, and end up not getting the job despite glowing reviews.

"I did an informational interview for an aspiring DS who messaged me on LinkedIn, and now their follow-up asks are getting increasingly time-consuming. How can I gently set a boundary?",13g0cug,"**tl;dr: I had a rather odd informational interview with someone almost 3 years ago, and now they’re asking me for resume and cover letter advice out of the blue. We do have colleagues in common — how can I gently/professionally set boundaries?**

I am a (somewhat newly minted) DS at a big tech company. I relied a lot on networking to get to this point, including cold messaging people on LinkedIn, so I’m sympathetic to aspiring folks who ask for career advice. I get occasional requests for this and I’m usually happy to talk with someone for 15-20 minutes or so.

Back in *2020* I accepted a request for an informational interview from an aspiring data analyst — we had a few connections in common. I honestly had forgotten about it until he messaged me yesterday, saying that he wants to apply to a job at my company — and would I review his resume and cover letter for him?

This struck me as odd because:

1) I haven’t heard from him in a long time. He didn’t keep in touch or anything, I literally talked with him for 15 minutes three years ago.

2) It’s a big ask - to review a job description, resume, cover letter and offer good editing advice. 

3) I have the feeling he’s fishing for a referral, which I’m not comfortable giving on account of not knowing him well.

All that said, I know that I’m at my limit of how much I’m willing to accommodate him, and I want to tread carefully because we do have some colleagues in common.Could anyone suggest a nice professional way to communicate this?

Any advice appreciated!

Edit: Thanks for the advice, everyone. I think my initial poor reaction was due to the style of his approach more than anything. Feeling a little sheepish, I’m going to do my best with his resume and see if I can help him on his way.

For the record, the referral system at my company starts with an attestation of how well you know the person - my understanding is that the minimum they request for is “former colleague” (e.g. “I’ve worked with this person in a professional capacity.”) for referrals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/13g0cug/i_did_an_informational_interview_for_an_aspiring/,alejo_sc,111,Networking,51,Top - year

I hate my job despite the title and prestige,1653342," my manager quit but did a very bad job with documentation and lots of errors. I inherited the work and i had the expectation of delivering. My stakeholder is very demanding and made me old managers life hell. The data source/tool that collects the data is horribly designed and we need to take into account the million ways people will use it. I communicated that i need a data engineer/ someone to help and nobody did anything about it despite saying if need help i can communicate it. I communicated that technical debt needs to be addressed but customer demands results in august. I did everything to best of my ability and my customers subordinates were happy but the actual manager/big customer was not happy. 

Same day i present my work,i get adhoc with delievery next day in data that isnt loaded/fixed and i need to clean it and present it in a matter of hours. I end up fucking it up because the deadline was few hours + more asks from customer last min.  I communicated that this is out of scope and I need more time and everybody just shoved work on my lap that i said i cant do it on such short notice. 

Customer being escalation happy escalated and now I am in trouble.

I got handed shit work, no documentation, and barely any support and after being overworked i still got a big complaint on me. I work weekends and weekdays. Weekdays going up to 8 am to 1 am the next day.

Honestly, some jobs are not worth it. Like its actually just not worth the money or title. I would take any junior title with low pay over this shit.

"Self-taught coder in first role. Want to job hop, but paralyzed by fear of the unknown. Dose of realism needed. Please help.",13pos9d,"Apologies in advance for the ramble. I’m just really in need of some objective advice right now.

So far I consider myself a moderate success story: With zero relevant education or experience, in my 30s I taught myself math, stats, and coding, then scored a job as a junior machine learning research engineer. In this job I analyze large data sets, run deep learning experiments in the cloud using large pre-trained models, and write back end code to serve these models for inference in operational products. My work is a mixture of ML research and MLOps. I’ve trained thousands of models, written tens (maybe low hundreds?) of thousands of lines of code, and even been listed on a couple papers and one patent. As a junior engineer I’m mostly told what to do, but I have significant freedom to decide how best to do it. This was exactly my goal when I first embarked on my improbable journey.

I’ve been in this role for 2.5 years now. I’ve learned so much and really loved it. But lately the sheen has worn off, and dissatisfaction has started to creep in. Basically I just need more money to support my family, and this job isn’t going to deliver it fast enough.

So now I feel significant pressure to find my second MLE job, but everything about that prospect terrifies me. My current job is all I’ve ever known in tech, and I’m just not experienced enough to get a feel for how competitive I’ll be in the market. I still feel weak compared to many colleagues, but maybe it’s just imposter syndrome. Also, my ML subfield (NLP) is moving so fast these days that the moment you learn something new it’s already out of date, making it impossible to ascertain how comprehensive or current my skill set actually is. So I just really don’t know.

Anyway, here is a grab bag of my skills and credentials, I guess:

- Education

    - Two MA degrees, one marginally relevant to NLP but not STEM/computational at all, so probably won’t wow any engineering managers

- Python

    - Very proficient

    - Have written tons of it, including packages, but almost all is internal/proprietary

    - Familiar with most of the basic ML/data analysis libraries, and some familiarity with deep learning libraries like PyTorch and transformers (never used TensorFlow)

- Linux

    - Fairly proficient

    - I use Bash and zsh everyday, both locally and on remote servers over ssh, writing and reading shell scripts with low-to-moderate complexity 
- SQL

    - Basic proficiency

    - I can compose simple SQL queries, and some moderately complex ones with Google’s help, but that’s about it. Not doing much with DBs these days.

- Software development

    - Fair amount of experience for 2.5 years, I think

    - I’ve worked with teams of other engineers and PhDs to to write the back ends of our ML-driven engines and software packages

    - I work every day with Git, CI/CD, testing, conda, and OOP, basically all in Python

    - We use the Agile framework. I fucking hate it, but anyway, I know the concepts and lingo

- AWS

    - Not certified, but familiar with the basic concepts and services. Never used any other cloud provider

    - We do most of our experimentation on S3-backed EC2, but are starting to use the SageMaker ecosystem now

- Math/stats

    - Strong enough algebra, calculus, linear algebra, and statistics to understand deep learning techniques and read the occasional research paper

    - No classes or grades or anything to prove this though. I just used Khan Academy for everything, so there’s no real paper trail

Beyond the above, I have started (though not finished) a handful of pet projects on GitHub and completed an absolute assload of MOOCs (I think I have like 26 Coursera certificates).

Things I’m still weak on include:

- Networking

    - As someone with a non-CS, non-STEM background, I have very few connections in the tech industry. Basically my network consists of my current coworkers and a few ex-coworkers who recently left

- Front end

    - Never built a website, dashboard, or GUI of any kind. If someone asked me to surface the outputs of a model to users, I’d have almost no idea where to begin. I could probably figure it out, but it’s not something I can currently

    - For this reason I feel as far from full-stack as one can be

- Data structures and algorithms

    - This is something I never directly studied, but rather have just picked up the very basics as needed on the job. As such my knowledge is superficial, patchy, and incomplete at best

    - I basically understand Big-O and the basic data structures. It’s been sufficient for my current job, but that’s it

    - Have never done any LeetCode or similar

Essentially my credentials boil down to “Someone else hired me as an MLE 2.5 years ago and hasn't fired me, so I can’t be *completely* incompetent, right…?” Lol. That just doesn’t seem very strong. If we used GitHub at work, such that hiring managers etc. could at least peruse what I’ve done, that would be great, but we don’t, so they can’t. Meanwhile, many would-be applicants will surely have degrees, publicly accessible school projects, and GPAs to point to, or else have at least as much work experience as me if not more.

So ... am I ready to jump? How can I assess whether I’m prepared, whether I’ll be competitive at all, and in which areas I absolutely must improve? I guess I just need more confidence and assurance in order to take the next step.

Is my internship worthless?,15m41kq,"I accepted an internship about 2 months ago at a very large tech company. The internship has nothing to do with my major (which is data science), and even in the interview process my boss effectively said “this isn’t a real job, but it’s a stepping stone”.

I was very excited for the opportunity to work for this company because I knew it would look great on a resume. But, I’m 32 years old (started college later than most) and the pay is fucking abysmal. On top of poor pay, it’s a commuter job and I have to drive minimum 1 hr every shift to work. Coming from working as a catering chef, this has been miserable. The pay is worse, the job is boring, there’s zero benefits, and because of Covid the networking connections while at work are effectively non existent (which was a selling point).

So my question is, is this even really worth it? After experiencing the work culture and what this company is like, I absolutely cannot see myself working for them post graduation, nor do they have much of a need in data science. Is it worth roughing out the internship to just simply put it on my resume?

"Everyone always talks about LLMs/ML in data science but no one ever talks about experimentation, ML's older sexier sister.",16uomoo,"As a data scientist primarily focused in causal inference and experiment design, I find that most conversation and questions from people trying to transition into DS always want to go into ML, but causal inference and experimentation is another very fun sub-field within DS. I'm biased since I'm in this sub-field but having done some ML stuff on the side, I much more enjoy the causal inference side of things.

Note that this post is primarily geared toward people with some experience. It's hard to break into experimentation with no background. Fresh PhDs though, particularly in social or physical sciences do well.

What's fun about about experimentation and causal inference:

1. Knowing why something caused something else is always valuable
2. Well designed experiments can be hard to design and execute, which is part of the challenge. A good experiment correctly captures the objectives of the product manager/business partner and answers a question that can be immediately acted upon once results are available.
3. Requires a combination of business thinking, strategy, and strong statistical foundations
4. Often is highly collaborative and builds your soft skills. I work with people in marketing, risk, finance, modeling, dashboarding teams to make sure things work well
5. Causal inference is not just A/B testing. There are plenty of situations where we need to get a causal understanding but an experiment is just not feasible. Tons of fun techniques here like instrumental variables, propensity score matching, causal forests, double ML etc. which have their own strengths and weaknesses
6. Experimentation is not just A/B testing. We have multi-arm bandits, factorial and fractional factorial experiment designs etc.
7. Usually don't have to worry about productionizing etc. ML is often 5 lines of code once you've massaged the data just right
8. It's a growing field. I see lots of job openings in experimentation and the skillset is hard to come by. It's not easy to do causal inference (both the experimental and non-experimental kind) and all the challenges of launching a business experiment require on the job training to be successful at.

If you're in the market for a new role, don't overlook experimentation (or think of it as less fun) :).

I have a ton of free compute... why won't anybody use it?,16pn49s,"I'm working on a dev tool that automatically scales python code horizontally to thousands of CPUs and GPUs. I have been working on this for the last two months and have a few consistent users.

I recently scraped emails from some of the largest python repos on github. Most of them are repos specifically for Bioinformaticians, Data Scientists, NLP Engineers, and people in the AI/ML space. Since I compiled this list of 50k emails and sent them out I'm getting a 5% response rate which isn't bad at all. About 50% of the responses are positive and a majority of them are people saying they think the idea is cool and they want to try it.

What is the most versatile regression method?,19abxl3,"TLDR: I worked as a data scientist a couple of years back, for most things throwing XGBoost at it was a simple and good enough solution. Is that still the case, or have there emerged new methods that are similarly ""universal"" (with a massive asterisk)?

To give background to the question, let's start with me. I am a software/ML engineer in Python, R, and Rust and have some data science experience from a couple of years back. Furthermore, I did my undergrad in Econometrics and a graduate degree in Statistics, so I am very familiar with most concepts. I am currently interviewing to switch jobs and the math round and coding round went really well, now I am invited over for a final ""data challenge"" in which I will have roughly 1h and a synthetic dataset with the goal of achieving some sort of prediction.

&#x200B;

My problem is: I am not fluent in data analysis anymore and have not really kept up with recent advancements. Back when was doing DS work, for most use cases using XGBoost was totally fine and received good enough results. This would have definitely been my go-to choice in 2019 to solve the challenge at hand. My question is: In general, is this still a good strategy, or should I have another go-to model?  


Disclaimer: Yes, I am absolutely, 100% aware that different models and machine learning techniques serve different use cases. I have experience as an MLE, but I am not going to build a custom Net for this task given the small scope. I am just looking for something that should handle most reasonable use cases well enough.

&#x200B;

I appreciate any and all insights as well as general tips. The reason why I believe this question is appropriate, is because I want to start a general discussion about which basic model is best for rather standard predictive tasks (regression and classification).",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/19abxl3/what_is_the_most_versatile_regression_method/,conebiter,111,ML,69,Top - year
Word of advice on taking on a Data Science masters (from someone who just completed one),180kgb9,"I just graduated with a masters in data science from a uk university. To say it was difficult would be an understatement, and it’s not just the program itself that made it so, but two external factors which (I’ll list below) made studying a challenge. 



1. WORK: If you have a hard job already, DON’T combine it with a data science masters. You could literally breakdown completely due to stress. My school recommend working only 10 hours per week and I ignored the advice because I needed the money. I worked 20 hours per week doing menial jobs. At some point I thought I would actually drop dead due to stress. Keep in mind that 20 hours is still part time work. I strongly recommend working a maximum  10 hours per week or not working at all if you’re prone to stress.   My classmates who worked full time during their masters had very poor grades (some even dropped out). 



2. Family and peer support:  I always thought of myself as a lone journeyman who took on the world without needing to speak to anyone. Uhh…. Yeah that went out the window completely when things got heated during the program. Not seeing family in the flesh  affected my mental health. I noticed that people who took the program with their families  were a lot happier than those of us who didn’t have any family around. Speaking to family, friends and classmates going through the same program really helped A LOT though. You really can’t go through this program as a loner. Life would hit you on the face like a brick for every single day of your existence if you attempt to do so. 

That’s my 2 cents. AA

EDIT: 
Course Selection: Just remembered this but uhh course selection is REALLY IMPORTANT. I had done enough online courses on data science before my masters, to know that neural networks and deep learning is something you study ON YOUR OWN, and  NOT as part of an official course. If you’re new to data science, pick the easiest courses for your masters. I saw enough people completely fail their courses (and subsequently the entire masters) because they wanted courses that sound trendy. Seriously that’s the only reason they chose them. Please research “Natural Language Engineering” and “Combinatorial Optimisation” before choosing it as a course alright. 😂😂",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/180kgb9/word_of_advice_on_taking_on_a_data_science/,abdulj07,111,Discussion,70,Top - year

I’m really getting frustrated with my career trajectory.,1bhav92,"I’m hoping to get some career advice. I was a special operator in the military on active duty, the kind you go through selection for, and did intelligence work when I was much younger.  I then transitioned to officer where I was managing a couple of large intelligence cells at up to division level. When I got out and was pursuing a masters I managed two very large restaurants as a general manager. After graduating I became a data scientist where I applied my work toward national security problems as a contractor. As an individual contributor I often worked with some high level military leaders. 

I left to go work at a tech company as an individual contributor because i wanted the credentials of having worked in tech and the money was good.

Why Gradient Boosted Decision Trees are so underappreciated in the industry?,17h40ok,"GBDT allow you to iterate very fast, they require no data preprocessing, enable you to incorporate business heuristics directly as features, and immediately show if there is explanatory power in features in relation to the target.

On tabular data problems, they outperform Neural Networks, and many use cases in the industry have tabular datasets.

Because of those characteristics, [they are winning solutions to all tabular competitions on Kaggle](https://jobs-in-data.com/blog/data-science-skills#sota-ml-models).

And yet, somehow they are not very popular.

On the chart below, I summarized learnings from 9,261 job descriptions crawled from 1605 companies in Jun-Sep 2023 (source: [https://jobs-in-data.com/blog/machine-learning-vs-data-scientist](https://jobs-in-data.com/blog/machine-learning-vs-data-scientist))

LGBM, XGboost, Catboost (combined together) are the 19th mentioned skill, e.g. with Tensorflow being x10 more popular.

EDIT \[Answering the main lines of critique\]:

1/ ""Job posting descriptions are written by random people and hence meaningless"":

Granted, there is for sure some noise in the data generation process of writing job descriptions.

But why do those random people know so much more about deep learning, keras, tensorflow, pytorch than GBDT? In other words, why is there a systematic trend in the noise? When the noise has a trend, it ceases to be noise.

Very few people actually did try to answer this, and I am grateful to them, but none of the explanations seem to be more credible than the statement that GBDTs are indeed underappreciated in the industry.

2/ ""I myself use GBDT all the time so the headline is wrong""This is availability bias. The single person's opinion (or 20 people opinion) vs 10.000 data points.

3/ ""This is more the bias of the Academia""

The job postings are scraped from the industry.

However, I personally think this is the root cause of the phenomenon. Academia shapes the minds of industry practitioners.

This is what companies look for when hiring data analysts,1594i5v,"For anyone interested, here are some of the trends that we have observed in the world of data when it comes to career as a data analyst/data scientist. (We are a German based data & software recruitment agency).

The role of a data analyst was in some ways more well defined previously. Where there are fewer possibilities, there are fewer expectations. Now, by the proliferation of tools and expansion of expectation, it blends increasingly with that of a data scientist. 

It’s now essential to have expertise in one or more programming languages, as well as database querying methodologies, both of which we’ll explore in more detail. 

Proficiency in R and Python, as well as knowing how to utilise DBT (data building tool). More on this [here](https://www.pl-talents.com/expertise-to-look-out-for-when-hiring-a-data-analyst/). 

Data analysts work with databases, so they absolutely need familiarity with writing SQL queries. PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

Additionally, data analysts can benefit from expertise with SQL-related technologies and frameworks:  SQLAlchemy,  Apache Spark SQL, HiveQL.

Data Visualisation and Storytelling tools. 

Working with databases is one thing, but data analysts need more than SQL. Data analysts now handle more complex and diverse datasets, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

How to correctly use sklearn Transformers in a Pipeline,18ngsgv,"  This article will explain how to use [Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) and [Transformers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) correctly in Scikit-Learn (sklearn) projects to speed up and reuse our model training process.

This piece complements and clarifies the official documentation on Pipeline examples and some common misunderstandings.

I hope that after reading this, you'll be able to use the Pipeline, an excellent design, to better complete your machine learning tasks.

 This article was originally published on my personal blog [Data Leads Future.](https://www.dataleadsfuture.com/ensuring-correct-use-of-transformers-in-scikit-learn-pipeline/) 

### Why use a Pipeline

As mentioned earlier, in a machine learning task, we often need to use various Transformers for data scaling and feature dimensionality reduction before training a model.

This presents several challenges:

* **Code complexity**: For each use of a Transformer, we have to go through initialization, `fit_transform`, and `transform` steps. Missing one step during a transformation could derail the entire training process.
* **Data leakage**: As we discussed, for each Transformer, we fit with train data and then transform both train and test data. We must avoid letting the distribution of the test data leak into the train data.
* **Code reusability**: A machine learning model includes not only the trained Estimator for prediction but also the data preprocessing steps. Therefore, a machine learning task comprising Transformers and an Estimator should be atomic and indivisible.
* **Hyperparameter tuning**: After setting up the steps of machine learning, we need to adjust hyperparameters to find the best combination of Transformer parameter values.

Scikit-Learn introduced the `Pipeline` module to solve these issues.

### What is a Pipeline

A `Pipeline` is a module in Scikit-Learn that implements the chain of responsibility design pattern.

When creating a Pipeline, we use the `steps` parameter to chain together multiple Transformers for initialization:

    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    
    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                               ('pca', PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42)),
                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))])

The [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#pipeline) points out that the last Transformer must be an Estimator.

If you don't need to specify each Transformer's name, you can simplify the creation of a Pipeline with `make_pipeline`:

    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    
    pipeline_2 = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(),
                               PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42),
                               RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))

 Understanding the Pipeline's mechanism from the source code

We've mentioned the importance of not letting test data variables leak into training data when using each Transformer.

This principle is relatively easy to ensure when each data preprocessing step is independent.

But what if we integrate these steps using a Pipeline?

If we look at the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#pipeline), we find it simply uses the fit  
 method on the entire dataset without explaining how to handle train and test data separately.

With this question in mind, I dived into the Pipeline's source code to find the answer.

Reading the source code revealed that although Pipeline implements `fit`, `fit_transform`, and `predict` methods, they work differently from regular Transformers.

Take the following Pipeline creation process as an example:

    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    
    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                               ('pca', PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42)),
                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))])

 The internal implementation can be represented by the following diagram: 

[ Internal implementation of the fit and predict methods when called. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/okhwyg75gl7c1.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=8106360fcaeb17deea2adf04fc34228dd31a9fd7)

As you can see, when we call the `fit` method, Pipeline first separates Transformers from the Estimator.

For each Transformer, Pipeline checks if there's a `fit_transform` method; if so, it calls it; otherwise, it calls `fit`.

For the Estimator, it calls `fit` directly.

For the `predict` method, Pipeline separates Transformers from the Estimator.

Pipeline calls each Transformer's `transform` method in sequence, followed by the Estimator's `predict`  
 method.

Therefore, when using a Pipeline, we still need to split train and test data. Then we simply call `fit` on the train data and `predict` on the test data.

There's a special case when combining Pipeline with `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning: you don't need to manually split train and test data. I'll explain this in more detail in the best practices section.

## Best Practices for Using Transformers and Pipeline in Actual Applications

Now that we've discussed the working principles of Transformers and Pipeline, it's time to fulfill the promise made in the title and talk about the best practices when combining Transformers with Pipeline in real projects.

### Combining Pipeline with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

In a machine learning project, selecting the right dataset processing and algorithm is one aspect. After debugging the initial steps, it's time for parameter optimization.

Using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`, you can try different parameters for the Estimator to find the best fit:

    import time
    
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    
    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                               ('pca', PCA()),
                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier())])
    param_grid = {'pca__n_components': [2, 'mle'],
                  'estimator__n_estimators': [3, 5, 7],
                  'estimator__max_depth': [3, 5]}
    
    start = time.perf_counter()
    clf = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)
    clf.fit(X, y)
    
    # It takes 2.39 seconds to finish the search on my laptop.
    print(f""It takes {time.perf_counter() - start} seconds to finish the search."")

 But in machine learning, hyperparameter tuning is not limited to Estimator parameters; it also involves combinations of Transformer parameters.

Integrating all steps with Pipeline allows for hyperparameter tuning of every element with different parameter combinations.

Note that during hyperparameter tuning, we no longer need to manually split train and test data. `GridSearchCV` will split the data into training and validation sets using [StratifiedKFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#stratified-k-fold), which implemented a k-fold cross validation mechanism.

[ StratifiedKFold iterative process of splitting train data and test data. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/uqnuo8fpgl7c1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd6b5f7edb2d4f5e71786fd6c0f45745ea2095d9)

 We can also set the number of folds for cross-validation and choose how many workers to use. The tuning process is illustrated in the following diagram: 

[ Internal implementation of GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/piqqv9nrgl7c1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb2a2d4739e8100e71559fb9f9e0cfaa4846803)

 Due to space constraints, I won't go into detail about `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` here. If you're interested, I can write another article explaining them next time. 

### Using the memory parameter to cache Transformer outputs

Of course, hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV` can be slow, but that's no worry, Pipeline provides a caching mechanism to speed up the tuning efficiency by caching the results of intermediate steps.

When initializing a Pipeline, you can pass in a memory parameter, which will cache the results after the first call to `fit` and `transform` for each transformer.

If subsequent calls to fit and `transform` use the same parameters, which is very likely during hyperparameter tuning, these steps will directly read the results from the cache instead of recalculating, significantly speeding up the efficiency when running the same Transformer repeatedly.

The `memory` parameter can accept the following values:

* The default is None: caching is not used.
* A string: providing a path to store the cached results.
* A `joblib.Memory` object: allows for finer-grained control, such as configuring the storage backend for the cache.

Next, let's use the previous `GridSearchCV` example, this time adding `memory` to the Pipeline to see how much speed can be improved:

    pipeline_m = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),
                               ('pca', PCA()),
                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier())],
                          memory='./cache')
    start = time.perf_counter()
    clf_m = GridSearchCV(pipeline_m, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)
    clf_m.fit(X, y)
    
    # It takes 0.22 seconds to finish the search with memory parameter.
    print(f""It takes {time.perf_counter() - start} seconds to finish the search with memory."")

As shown, with caching, the tuning process only takes 0.2 seconds, a significant speed increase from the previous 2.4 seconds.

### How to debug Scikit-Learn Pipeline

After integrating Transformers into a Pipeline, the entire preprocessing and transformation process becomes a black box. It can be difficult to understand which step the process is currently on.

Fortunately, we can solve this problem by adding logging to the Pipeline.  
We need to create custom transformers to add logging at each step of data transformation.

Here's an example of adding logging with Python's standard logging library:

First, you need to configure a logger:

    import logging
    
    from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
    
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    logger = logging.getLogger()

 Next, you can create a custom Transformer and add logging within its methods: 

    class LoggingTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
        def __init__(self, transformer):
            self.transformer = transformer
            self.real_name = self.transformer.__class__.__name__
    
        def fit(self, X, y=None):
            logging.info(f""Begin fit: {self.real_name}"")
            self.transformer.fit(X, y)
            logging.info(f""End fit: {self.real_name}"")
            return self
    
        def fit_transform(self, X, y=None):
            logging.info(f""Begin fit_transform: {self.real_name}"")
            X_fit_transformed = self.transformer.fit_transform(X, y)
            logging.info(f""End fit_transform: {self.real_name}"")
            return X_fit_transformed
    
        def transform(self, X):
            logging.info(f""Begin transform: {self.real_name}"")
            X_transformed = self.transformer.transform(X)
            logging.info(f""End transform: {self.real_name}"")
            return X_transformed

 Then you can use this `LoggingTransformer` when creating your Pipeline: 

    pipeline_logging = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', LoggingTransformer(StandardScaler())),
                                 ('pca', LoggingTransformer(PCA(n_components=2))),
                                 ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=5, max_depth=3))])
    pipeline_logging.fit(X_train, y_train)

[ The effect after adding the LoggingTransformer. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/53kl3padhl7c1.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3e3d9dcf25f0ee8dc7234e1db9280ce1cd15b0d)

When you use `pipeline.fit`, it will call the `fit` and `transform` methods for each step in turn and log the appropriate messages.

### Use passthrough in Scikit-Learn Pipeline

In a Pipeline, a step can be set to `'passthrough`', which means that for this specific step, the input data will pass through unchanged to the next step.

This is useful when you want to selectively enable/disable certain steps in a complex pipeline.

Taking the code example above, we know that when using `DecisionTree` or `RandomForest`, standardizing the data is unnecessary, so we can use `passthrough` to skip this step.

An example would be as follows:

    param_grid = {'scaler': ['passthrough'],
                  'pca__n_components': [2, 'mle'],
                  'estimator__n_estimators': [3, 5, 7],
                  'estimator__max_depth': [3, 5]}
    clf = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)
    clf.fit(X, y)

 Reusing the Pipeline

After a journey of trials and tribulations, we finally have a well-performing machine learning model.

Now, you might consider how to reuse this model, share it with colleagues, or deploy it in a production environment.

However, the result of a model's training includes not only the model itself but also the various data processing steps, which all need to be saved.

Using `joblib` and Pipeline, we can save the entire training process for later use. The following code provides a simple example:

    from joblib import dump, load
    
    # save pipeline
    dump(pipeline, 'model_pipeline.joblib')
    
    # load pipeline
    loaded_pipeline = load('model_pipeline.joblib')
    
    # predict with loaded pipeline
    loaded_predictions = loaded_pipeline.predict(X_test)

How much software engineering skills does it take to do a DS job?,17xobtu,"I’ve been trying to get into data science for a few months (i have a bs in sociology and have done analytics for my course).

I thought it was perfect for me because it sounded like a business role that look at numbers.

But when I look at the data scientist job descriptions out there, more than half are asking for software engineering skills. I’m familiar with the statistics but I know nothing about docker, github, spark or deploying models to production. Isn’t that the role of a software engineer?

Prior to this, I worked at General Motors as a Data Scientist and no one knew what they were doing there either.

I’ve been applying outside and haven’t gotten anything. I’m wondering if a PhD would help me secure a job with real Data Science.

EDIT:
I guess I should clarify. I think I could probably get a ""real DS job"" without a PhD and I don't think it is required. Here are the reasons I would consider a PhD:

1) I have no demonstrable Data Science professional experience in the work experience I have. This makes getting a new Data Science job challenging. With a PhD, I can get some real DS work experience solving complex problems

2) With a PhD, I could specialize in a science I'm interested in and become a scientist exploring that topic with the aide of DS rather than DS working in tech to help companies increase ad revenue. Basically, it feels like being a specialty DS, like a Climate Data Scientist or a Bioinformatics Data Scientist would benefit from a PhD. I could be wrong though.

Been stuck on a problem. Just need to know whether this problem statement is solvable or not.,15753qp,"I've been stuck on the following problem for weeks now. To be clear I'm not asking the community to provide a full solution. Just a few ideas or at least confirmation on whether this problem statement is solvable with the data available at hand. Thanks.

**Context:** I work for a company that rents out stuff. During user checkout, there's a rule-based risk engine that determines whether to auto-approve user (takes seconds) or send for manual approval (takes days). This engine utilizes only basic features such as credit score, rent items category, cart value etc. Lets say that around 40% of all instances go to manual approval. Actual rejection rate is around 1-2% that means most of the cases sent for manual approval could have just been auto-approved.

**Objective:** Reduce dependency on manual approval as much as possible (to lets say 5%). If this was a binary classification task (manual or not) then we'd say recall is important here. Thus, deprecate legacy system as it is too rudimentary.

Now, boss wants me to achieve this by creating a regression model using customer credit history, and purchase history to predict ***maximum allowed***  ^(†)***active-sourcing-cost per user***. So that if a user tries checking out cart that brings their total active sourcing cost above their max allowed limit, they will be sent for manual approval instead of auto-approve.

>^(†)*active-sourcing-cost is the total purchase cost to company of all items the user currently is renting*

**Data available:** User purchase history, user credit history (experian), product details, NPA data (data of users who failed to return the items they have rented, thus defaulted)

**Issues with proposed solution:**

1. Max allowed sourcing cost per user unavailable as the target variable (No recorded ground truth for any samples)
2. No relevant proxy variables available as ground truth (that I can think of)

Tried explaining that lack of relevant ground truth is an issue. But am being pushed for a solution so have to produce.

**My alternate half-baked solution:**

1. Use legacy system for auto approvals only. This acts as a filter.
2. To the rest of the data that would otherwise be sent for manual verification we add NPA users and tag as a negative class. This would be the training data.
3. Train binary classification model (npa vs. not npa).
4. What the model classifies as NPA would then be sent for manual, rest will be auto approved.

Career Movement After Hitting Manager,1bi3u1k,"Hi all,

I’m looking for people’s advice on making potentially a downward move in my DS career. Basically, I work for a company with a relatively small DS department in a relatively low-paying business sector. Because I got in on the team early, and I have good people skills, I got promoted to a manager position about a year and a half ago. The company is good to work for, and I don’t mind management work, but the pay gap that comes with the industry has been feeling like more of an opportunity cost the longer I stay there, so I’ve started to look at other positions.

I’m guessing it would be hard to manage a team in another industry without the requisite domain experience, so my question is this: would it be seen as a negative on my resume if I ended up having to take a “lower-level” DS job to get experience in that industry, or is that more common than I think? I’m less concerned about a pay decrease since I’m pretty sure it will be an increase either way, but I’m thinking of how it might look on a resume.

For additional context, I have about 4 years of DS experience, all in my current industry, which I’m keeping a secret in case someone from my employer is on here :)

Second, this is an outline, you need to look at each part, go through the links, and really digest the material before moving on. Third, every part of the outline is dense; there is no fluff, and you will will probably need to do multiple passes through the outline.

Also, think of this outline as a gift. It is being provided without warranty, or any guarantee of any kind.

How to deal with data scientists,194prhf,"I'm an R&D engineer working for an international company in the chemical/engineering business. I am the only one in my team with some data analytics skills. I typically spend about 20% of my time coding and analysing data for my projects (sometimes I get asked to support other colleagues too). Nothing fancy, some statistical analysis, a lot of data viz and sometimes simple modelling mostly for inferential purposes.
Over the years my company built a relatively large and very centralized data science team, they do the heavy lifting and create production quality code.  
In the early days I enjoyed dealing with them, they were happy that I could read the code and understand the lingo so we could cooperate very smoothly on the same project. Typically we went through their code together on a weekly basis. By the end of the project  I was aware of most of the technical decision made along the way and I could explain it pretty comfortably to the stakeholders. So much so that I started thing about a career switch. Now that team is gone and the newcomers are more senior and operate very differently. They typically provide their report on powerpoint and quite high level too, I had a few instances when I reached out and got dismissed. One particular time after they analysed some data for an RD&E project I asked the code specifying that I was really eager to learn and I got denied. Their justification was that they were afraid their code would be used the wrong way.  
They don't seem to be interested in cooperating the same way, they rather get the data, ask all the questions, and share their final findings. They do not interact much along the way.

This situation has been going on for over a year already, I thought I could find a sweet spot bridging between RD&E and data science, but I'm now having second thoughts and thinking I'm better off in my bubble. I'm very hesitant involving them in any project unless strictly necessary.   
I'm interested to hear some opinion from data scientists as I'm trying to put myself in their shoes. Am I being too intrusive? Have you ever had similar experiences from the opposite side?

* How are projects assigned across the team?
* How do team members collaborate?
* How is the scope of a project typically determined?

Should I relocate for first job?,13sdge6,"I was offered an MLE role that pays \~100K + options (pre-IPO) at a mid sized and well funded startup. This is also my first full time offer that I've received (I am a recent new grad). The hitch however - is that they want me to relocate to their office to be on site (not a coast city but think L/MCOL midwest type city).

The request comes at a bit of a surprise because I communicated throughout the process that I would prefer to stay in my home state. Though, I also said I wouldn't mind onboarding on site and flying out when needed either - and in the moment they seemed receptive about this.

Since getting the offer I have been feeling strong reservations about leaving to relocate. In my home state I have both parents (one of which has an ongoing health condition), many of my closest friends, as well as a long term girlfriend of six years.

I am curious to hear what other people who've been in similar circumstances have done. One thought I had was that I could ""suck-it-up"" for a year and just get the experience down - but I am not sure if this is a good mindset to be going into a job with.

I am open to any advice and thoughts people can share - I would greatly appreciate it all. TIA!

"I made a Python package for creating UpSet plots to visualize interacting sets, release v0.1.2 is available now!",1b9w904,"&#x200B;

# TLDR

**upsetty** is a Python package I built to create UpSet plots and visualize intersecting sets. You can use the project yourself by installing with:

    pip install upsetty 

Project GitHub Page: [https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty](https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty)

Project PyPI Page: [https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/](https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/)

# Background

Recently I received a work assignment where the business partners wanted us to analyze the overlap of users across different platforms within our digital ecosystem, with the ultimate goal of determining which platforms are underutilized or driving the most engagement.

When I was exploring the data, I realized I didn't have a great mechanism for visualizing set interactions, so I started looking into [UpSet plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UpSet_Plot). I think these diagrams are a much more elegant way of visualizing overlapping sets than alternatives such as Venn and Euler diagrams. I consulted [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@narayanmahto/visualizing-intersecting-sets-upset-chart-in-python-cf72e4cad5b1) that purported to explain how to create these plots in Python, but the instructions seemed to have been ripped directly from the projects' GitHub pages, which have not been updated in several years.

[One project by Lex et. al 2014](https://upset.app/) seems to work fairly well, but it has that 'matplotlib-esque' look to it. In other words, it seems visually outdated. I like creating views with libraries like Plotly, because it has a more modern look and feel, but noticed there is no UpSet figure available in the figure factory. So, I decided to create my own.

# Introducing 'upsetty'

[upsetty](https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty) is a new Python package [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/) that you can use to create upset plots to visualize intersecting sets. It's built with Plotly, and you can change the formatting/color scheme to your liking.

"As a non-data-scientist, assess my approach for finding the ""most important"" columns in a dataset",18ut4si,"I'm building a product for the video game, League of Legends, that will give players 3-6 distinct things to focus on in the game, that will increase their chances of winning the most.

For my technical background, I thought I wanted to be a data scientist, but transitioned to data engineering, so I have a very fundamental grasp of machine learning concepts. This is why I want input from all of you wonderfully smart people about the way I want to calculate these ""important"" columns.

I know that the world of explanability is still uncertain, but here is my approach:

1. I am given a dataset of matches of a single player, where each row represents the stats of this player at the end of the match. There are \~100 columns (of things like kills, assists, damage dealt, etc) after dropping the columns with any NULLS in it.
   1. There is a binary WIN column that shows whether the player won the match or not. This is the column we are most interested in
2. I train a simple tree-based model on this data, and get the list of ""feature importances"" using sklearn's `permutation_importance()` function.
   1. For some reason (maybe someone can explain), there are a large number of columns that return a ZERO feature importance after computing this.
3. This is where I do things differently: I RETRAIN the model using the same dataset, but without the columns that returned 0 importance on the last ""run""
4. I basically repeat this process until the list of feature importances doesn't contain ZERO.
   1. The end result is that there are usually 3-20 columns left (depending on the model).
5. I take the top N (haven't decided yet) columns and ""give"" them to the user to focus on in their next game

Theoretically, if ""feature importance"" really lives up to it's name, the ending model should have only the ""most important"" columns when trying to achieve a win.

I've tried using SHAP/LIME, but they were more complicated that using straight feature importance.

Like I mentioned, I don't have classical training in ML or Statistics, so all of this is stuff I tried to learn on my own at one point. I appreciate any helpful advice on if this approach makes sense/is valid. 

# The big question is: are there any problems with this approach, and are the resulting set of columns truly the ""most important?""",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/18ut4si/as_a_nondatascientist_assess_my_approach_for/,NFeruch,93,ML,56,Top - year
Mistake to bring up preference for ML during interview?,16dfynb,"I had an interview a while back with a banking company for a data scientist position.

I said that I've been in positions in the past where the company wanted a ""data scientist"" but the duties were solely focused on data governance and data pipelines with no modeling whatsoever. The interviewer told me they have a separate data engineering team and that their data science team primarily focuses on modeling.

A week later I was informed I was not selected to continue in the interview process. In my feedback, they said it was because ""it seemed you were more interested in the modeling piece"".

Whats your approach when it comes to decide whether or not eliminate variables from a dataset?,15o6hei,"Newbie here asking for a bit of wisdom from my senior peers.

Im currently finishing my masters in Data Science and Im now working in a real project for a real company with real data. Basically the goal is to build predictive models capable of determining the properties of certain manufactured products (so its a regression problem, basically).

I have several datasets that in total represent about 250 different variables and Im doing the preliminary EDA on them before doing the actual modelling.

Im running into some categorical variables that have very low cardinality. For instance, dichotomous variables in which one of the classes is severely under represented (somewhere between 5% and less than 1% of the records).

Im trying to go into the modelling with a dataset as ""light"" as possible but I dont want to lose valuable information in the process.

So my question is what do you usually do in these cases? Do you keep them until the modelling confirms their uselesness to predict, do you delete them outright, or you decide what to do based on a preliminary analysis like a correlation or cramers V analysis of said variable in relation to the target variable(s)?

Nothing to do,14xvd0b,"I've got nothing to do at the moment. With all of my major projects I'm waiting for someone else's input. Usually, there's small progress, then I'm excited to get working. Then something else comes up, and there's another wait of 2-4 weeks for one thing or another. 

I tried padding my schedule with useful stuff like ad-hoc analyses, strategising, prep work for infrastructure changes, and networking. Infrastructure work is limited due to low data maturity and heavy silos, though. There's also a limit to how much networking one can do.

I've run out of meaningful things to do. This has been going on for 6 months and I'm starting to feel burned out. So, I also don't have the energy to learn anymore, maybe because I'm exhausted, maybe because it's lonely and currently void of any practical application.

[Need advice]I Want to Leave MAANG a Month After Being Hired,1buvnuw,"(Hope this is the right subreddit as many people post job-related/job-seeking questions. If not, I'm sorry, that's an honest mistake.)

Hello everyone. I was recently hired by one of the big corporations, and I would appreciate advice from the community.

I was offered a high-level DS manager position at one of the MAANG companies. During the hiring process, I discussed with the hiring manager that I would start as an individual contributor, focusing on helping to improve the recommendation engine. Several months later, I was supposed to transition into managing a small team. I was extremely excited, it’s MAANG, after all.

However, on my very first day of the job, my manager’s peer informed me that there had been a reorg. As a result, the tasks we had initially discussed would not be happening. To make matters worse, it turned out that my manager’s planned promotion didn’t materialize, leaving no team for me to manage. I thought, “Okay, I can live with this. Worst-case scenario, I’ll transfer to another team later.”

Fast forward two weeks, and I honestly hate it. The tools we use are awful. Simple tasks that would take minutes outside of big tech now take up to an hour because our small databases constantly crash under load. Even building a basic causal model becomes incredibly challenging because we can’t extract data from the database for a sufficiently long period. When I raised these concerns with my manager, their response was, “I’m not a fan of complex modeling. If you want to do that, let’s outsource it to the Data Engineering (DE) team.”

What’s more, my daily work involves adding charts to dashboards and handling ad hoc requests from various stakeholders. Nobody can clearly state our long-term goals or what we’re trying to achieve. Our OKRs are DAU and Revenue, which are essentially driven by other company products (lol). The most disconcerting part is that every other Data Scientist in our part of the organization seems to be doing the same — ad-hocs, reports, and dashboards. Frankly, this doesn’t feel like DS work at all.

In my previous workplace, I held the responsibility of creating models and introducing new ways to leverage data to increase our KPIs. My team was first to introduce causal modeling and ML-based user segmentation, we’ve also piloted several other things that involved shipping models to production. When I decided to leave, my employer has repeated several times that should anything go wrong, I shouldn’t hesitate and come back to working for them. I’m seriously consider this option now. By the way it wasn't a small shop, that was an international company with petabytes of data and over a billion of revenue per year. Not the MAANG level though.

My current job offers better compensation, particularly if I can vest my stock options. However, during these several weeks, we’ve already experienced another reorganization (3rd or 4th in 1.5 years), making it highly unlikely that I’ll vest before the next round of layoffs.

What would be the right move? To those familiar with MAANG companies, I’d appreciate your insights. Is this situation normal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1buvnuw/need_advicei_want_to_leave_maang_a_month_after/,Deep-Technology-6842,114,Career Discussion,101,Top - year

Anyways, they offered to help shop me around to some other internal teams and I'll be meeting with two other DS managers in the next week. Before I meet with them, I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice for the situation and how to proceed. I'd really appreciate it.

Does anyone have any advice for how to use these meetings to their fullest, and maximize my chance of landing another role? How direct should I be about wanting to join their teams? I know my biggest selling point is that there's no training period, I'm already familiar with all the datasets and industry. I'm going to spend tomorrow trying to summarize all the work I've done at the company since I got hired.

Some other key details below:

- Was told I was rehire eligible. They specifically said that severance wouldn't be impacted if I boomeranged unless I switched teams before final date (1 month).
- Worked for over a year and have 2.5 years of experience in data science.
- Probably was on the bottom half of performers, but I wasn't the worst. I was the most recent hire though. My boss's boss offered to write a letter of recommendation, probably was a casualty of money, seniority, and not being a top performer. Was given a large new project two weeks ago.
- The company is large but has a small amount of tech and is about to lose a lot of money in the coming year. Could be a negative for staying if I find a new role.

I'm going to keep the ranting to a minimum because this post is pretty identifiable, but I'm honestly at a loss of what to do.

* My goal is to continue progressing in mt career and eventually getting a job at a top tier company in terms of compensation

i think i built the easiest way for python developers to interact with the cloud (and at a massive scale),1b0zcek,"over the last 6 months I've become obsessed with the cloud abstraction space. the more I started to dig the more it made me realized that adoption has been super low... way lower than it should be. it appears that adoption has been incredibly low because the existing solutions are prohibitively complex, costly, and don't meet organizational security compliance. 

this research along with many user interviews led me to the creation of [Burla](https://www.burla.dev/). this is the world's simplest cluster compute software. it scales across thousands of computers in the cloud with no setup and one line of code.  

Burla is...

* free and open source software
* installable in your cloud with one command
* available as a managed services at 1/3 the price of other abstractions
* a python package with one function and two arguments
* a tool that just works. The developer experience is local and it re-raises exceptions and streams output locally. Packages are automatically synced, we clone your local env and then cache it.

happy to elaborate more on features in functionality, I will be releasing the open source and managed version over the next couple of weeks.

Is it even worth it for me to try to learn new data science methodologies and techniques at this point?,1apf2gc,"I got my MS in stats in 2020 and had about 3.5 years experience as a data analyst at that time. I wanted to break into data science, and so it being lock down and nothing else for me to do, I started teaching myself the cutting edge of the field at the time, things like neural nets and a bunch of advanced ML techniques. I did several projects on my own (no, not just titanic and mnist datasets) and created an online public portfolio. I applied to tons of data science jobs but had no luck. I've been able to increase my salary through a progression of analyst jobs, but none of them really use anything advanced. The one I was at before had a little tiny bit of clustering and FA, and maybe a basic regression model, the one I'm at now is literally all just SQL dashboarding. 

After my first move in Feb '21, I kind of just stopped trying to stay on top of the field, since I got a higher salary and I just kind of burnt out of doing so much stuff on my own to try and make myself more marketable. I just did other things with my life for a few years, but I'm feeling ready for another move now. I notice now data science positions are asking for AI, GPT4, LlaMa, and those things weren't around when I was really working on my skills. I'm willing to learn those things if there's a good chance I'll use them, but I haven't used tensorflow, keras, or sklearn at all despite sinking massive amounts of my personal time into them.

I think part of it is there seem to be no junior level data scientist roles. It seems at most places, analyst is a different career path that tops out at management instead of more advanced methodologies, and so it doesn't really get me any closer to data scientist. Most open DS positions I see are senior or even manager and so I'm nowhere near qualified for them.

I'm in a bit of a conundrum. I have been working in a new role for the past 3 months as a data scientist and a small insurance company. We have around 5 departments of between 3-7 people and am the first DS to work in this company. Meaning my JD was basically pulled from data work requests of different departments.

&#x200B;

I think this is an incredibly slow way of making the company utilize my skillset and become data-driven, I was thinking of holding training sessions weekly or every 2 days with a member of each department to get them up to speed. To do simple tasks like creating graphs, modifying small snippets of code for slightly different results, and being able to debug some problems in the predictive models. 

I wanted some feedback on whether anyone has considered training staff at the job they work and if so how it went. Any views will be appreciated",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/142d3br/first_data_scientist_in_the_company/,Prestigious_Virus_33,84,Career,21,Top - year
Are all technical tests for Machine Learning internships like this ?,141e7ou,"As a student and a beginner in the field, I am currently applying for a Machine Learning Summer Internship in many companies in my country. 
One big tech company who specializes in big data deemed my resume as good and sent me a technical test in the form of a coding game. 
I was glad to have this opportunity and before i accessed the game, I revised thoroughly all the skills and everything that i've worked with in the projects mentioned in my resume. 
I was however surprised to find that of all the 63 questions on this test , not one question was about ML. All of the questions were instead about web developement technologies such as Javascript, Angular and Docker.
I do not get it. I expected some SQL, some Python or Java problems, some questions about the basics of ML and DL, Hadoop or things like that.
I feel discouraged as i have wasted 2 hours of my day working on this test and two days preparing for it . I would like to know if all technical tests in this field are this way ?

Why are there no good graph visualisation programs?,17212yf,"Does anyone know of any half decent graph/network visualisation programs? Gephi is very frustrating to use (can only view up to 20 attribute columns at once, can't inspect node/edge attributes from the graph view, attribute values only allow you to copy the abbreviated scientific notation form etc.)

This is what I am trying to do... I have a graph (heterogenous but I can compress it to homogenous if absolutely necessary) and I want to be able to interactively visualise said graph. If I click on a node or edge, I wish to be able to see the attributes of that node or edge. Preferably, I'd also be able to colour nodes and edges by attribute.

There seems to be a few small bespoke projects but from the few I've tried, none have achieved what I have outlined above - what I would have thought to be the bare minimum for a graph visualisation application.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**

Cytoscape standalone is definitely the way to go for me. Would highly recommend over Gephi. Still had to flatten my heterogenous graph, appending all attributes across all types, but with a specified `TYPE` attribute you can conditionally colour within Cytoscape so it gets you there in the end (bit annoying that every node/edge has redundant attributes from other node/edge types but it's not the end of the world.)

Heated debate with leadership because of Excel,16tujyf,"I work for a small company that deals with claims process for major insurance companies. Medical bills, car repair authorization, you got it.

I was hired to improve the data analysis area, to deliver insights for key people on the organization. SLAs control, trend lines of the customer demand to better allocate our people on days/shifts, etc.,

They gave me a blank check to do whatever I needed to. 

Seemed like a dream becaming true. No pre-requisites, full control of my work and a great opportunity to expand my portfolio.

And honestly, I delivered a great work. 

A whole ecosystem using SQL and R on a cloud server. SQL to consolidate the data (and importing legacy data from other systems), ETL scripts running on a regular basis to do database tasks, Shiny dashboards with credentials for leaders and other people, webapps with forms to control data input, custom APIs to collect data from a Help Desk solution and supply ML models to serve another endpoint for predictions, etc.

But I'm facing a new and frustrating problem: people on leadership positions keeps using Excel. I saw other bosses telling their people to put data on spreadsheets, causing wrong and outdated reports for the part of the company that uses my tools properly.

And they keep asking people to create spreadsheets, when they can even export data on this format from the dashboards.

Yesterday I got on a heated debate with my boss about this. 

I need some advise. It's a nice company overall, on a industry that I know a lot (insurance is part of my academic formation) and I don't know how to handle this without putting my job at risk.

**TL;DR:** People refusing to abandon Excel and keeps creating spreadsheets and reports disconnected from the data ecosystem that I created, causing all sorts of problems. What I need to do to solve this?

Introverted personalities in DS?,14q0rx0,"I wanted to get some insight from any senior level managers who are in DS or anyone who made the climb from analyst to DS management. 

One of the main concerns I have regarding this in my career path, is that I’m not the most outgoing, sociable, talkative person. My background is in BS math and stats -> MS stats, and I’ve always been the quiet kid who just does the work, goes to lecture, and goes home. I am talkative with friends, but not so much people I work with. 

I think the best way to describe my personality is an academic, but doesn’t like academia, and who wants to be industry. 

I am an academic at heart and am curious and love the “geeky” subjects like math and stats and programming, and enjoy talking to people about it, but don’t want to do a PhD and want to end up in industry.

The issue with this is that I feel with my personality, I’m going to have a hard time really climbing the ladder in DS.

I could do the hard skills and technical part very well, but the people related stuff I find myself to be kind of intimidated by.

For example, in a previous internship, I had no problem taking the project my manager had for me, completing it quickly, picking up new tasks, doing those, and just getting things done. Head down doing the work, communicating with my manager, and moving on. 

However, sometimes he would say “hey I don’t think I can make this meeting with product team and marketing team, can you just talk about updates to our work here from the last few weeks?”.

And whenever he said that I’d just have this massive pit in my stomach, and be dreading that call the full day. 

It’s weird because I thought it was social anxiety, but outside of work in casual, nightlife settings I’m very comfortable talking to people.

It’s just when it’s work related I think I feel like I’m being judged and can’t really act the same.

I also find myself actively avoiding roles which say “client facing” in the JDs too cause of this fear 

I’d like to move up in my career, but idk what else to do besides faking it till I make it. I’m worried my career will stagnate cause of this.

Maybe we're using too much data to train models,1br0kjc,"If you make the weak analogy between LLMs and humans / other organisms, we find that the LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data. So much so that a human being may never process that much information over their developmental years. Of course, the brain seems to be a foundation model that has been trained over all of its ascendant's data, which could be argued to be much more than all of the internet. But I don't think the information coming from our ancestors is as detailed as the information we gain from actually experiencing and learning things.

So, my shower thought was that maybe we are using way too much data to train the models. Clearly, there is enough information in much less data to gain a deep understanding of the world.

I do recognize that it's the trillion dollar question to construct a model that would need less data to develop as good of a world model as gpt4 or the other sota models.

I work as a Data Scientist at a small company in western Massachusetts, near Springfield MA. I started working here after graduating college May of 2022- my degree was in Math and Philosophy. When I started work in October 2022, I was only guaranteed 3 months at the job. I was being paid 15$ an hour for the first month (this was like a onboarding period). Then once I settled, it got increased to 18$ per hour. After the 3 months, I got a further salary bump to 24$ an hour. 

This April (6 months into the job), I negotiated my salary for a raise for the first time. Being my first ever salary negotiation, I feel like I kinda undersold myself. There was a bit of a confusion on the final agreement, but basically my salary was increased to 70k per year (33.65$ an hour).

Overall, I think this is a good salary. Especially when I look at where I was compared to where I am now, and the cost of living in this areas, there’s a lot to be thankful for.

Solving a real problem with your side projects,13zopht,"Just thought I'd throw this out there, but I've noticed that almost all side projects have one thing in common: they don't solve a real problem and there's no reason anyone would ever actually use it.

A commom theme when someone is starting a DS side project, they start thinking about what technologies they can use, what datasets are available, what models they want to try, etc. 

What if instead, you think about the problems in your life and the things you care about. You can still keep your ML toolbox in your head, but the focus should be on making a model that someone (hopefully you) would actually want to use. 

The problem with this type of ML side project is that only 20% of the time is spent on pure ML, however that is kind of the reality of any DS position anyway. So it seems like a more fruitful exercise to building the right skills for applying ML models to generate value and solve problems.

"Spark, Dask, DuckDB, Polars: TPC-H Benchmarks at Scale",17qm6ob,"I gave this talk at PyData NYC last week. It was fun working with devs from various projects (Dask, Arrow, Polars, Spark) in the week leading up to the event. Thought I'd share a re-recording of it here

[https://youtu.be/wKH0-zs2g\_U](https://youtu.be/wKH0-zs2g_U)

This is the result of a couple weeks of work comparing large data frameworks on benchmarks ranging in size 10GB to 10TB. No project wins. It's really interesting analyzing results though.

DuckDB and Dask are the only projects that reliably finish things (although possibly Dask's success here has to do with me knowing Dask better than the others). DuckDB is way faster at small scale (along with Polars). Dask and Spark are generally more robust and performant at large scale, mostly because they're able to parallelize S3 access. Really-good-S3 access seems to be the way you win at real-world cloud performance.

Looking more deeply at Dask results, we're wildly inefficient. There's at least a 2x-5x performance increase to be had here. Given that Dask does about as well as any other project on cloud this really means that \*no one\* has optimized cloud well yet.

This talk also goes into how we attempted to address bias (super hard to do in benchmarks). We had active collaborations with Polars and Spark people (made Polars quite a bit faster during this process actually). See [https://matthewrocklin.com/biased-benchmarks.html](https://matthewrocklin.com/biased-benchmarks.html) for more thoughts.

This also shows the improvement Dask made in the last six months. Dask used to suck at benchmarks. Now it doesn't win, but reliably places among the top. This is due to ...

1. Arrow strings
2. New shuffling algorithms
3. Query optimization

There's a lot of work for projects like Dask and Polars to fix themselves up in this space. They're both moving pretty fast right now. I'm curious to see how they progress in the next few months.

For future work I'd like to expand this out a bit beyond TPC-H. TPC-H is great because they're fairly serious queries (lots of tables, lots of joins) and not micro-benchmarks. We could use broader coverage though. Any ideas?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17qm6ob/spark_dask_duckdb_polars_tpch_benchmarks_at_scale/,mrocklin,71,Discussion,17,Top - year
Identity Crisis in Data Science,178vvrk,"Anyone else confused where they fit in data science? There's a huge range of backgrounds, from bootcamps to Ph.D.s. I've found DS quite unwelcoming because of this. Everyone is trying to distinguish themselves from the ""fakers,"" while most companies needs are quite basic.

I've been working on a DS master's degree for a year. I certainly know more than the typical data analyst or self-taught MOOCs student, but I'm overwhelmed by the interdisciplinary nature of the field. I've invested countless hours and thousands of dollars, yet there's a lifetime more to learn. This makes me question whether I want to continue in the field. When I talk to computer scientists, they're all very encouraging and emphasize that, although difficult, everyone can learn to code. When I talk to other data scientists, I get an air of elitism.

I think this happens because data science is a relatively new field. Other specialized skills like accounting, law, or finance have had time to settle into a list of requirements and utilize certifications where necessary. Since we have one title to describe a huge population, people end up getting defensive so they're not grouped together with the less qualified. Maybe overtime this resolves itself as data science expands into more titles. For now, I feel caught between both sides of the argument. I have no desire to get a PhD and a lot of imposter syndrome. It leaves me feeling like I should have gone MBA -> product management and called it a day.  On the flip side, when I explain basic stats at work, I'm met with blank stares, leading me to think the push for Ph.Ds is more about ego than practicality. My hope is to see clearer distinction in titles and more encouragement in the field than discouragement. 

For those of you in the middle like me, where have y'all had success? What kinds of industries, companies, or roles do you target?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/178vvrk/identity_crisis_in_data_science/,n96j77,70,Discussion,33,Top - year
Is it normal to both lack documentation & have a hard time completing tasks without colleagues assistance as a new hire? Not sure if I'm simply not cut out for data analytics.,153yntq,"Hi everyone.

So, it's been about six months since I began my first data analyst role at a massive FANG-esque company, and I'm feeling a bit defeated. Despite my efforts, I just missed another deadline. This happened partly because I lost a considerable amount of time waiting for clear answers or direction, and also because I made an error when pulling a join together correctly.

The problem is, I'm always on my own trying to figure things out when handling requests.  I come away from discussions with requestors not sure of what they want, and with zero documentation, an abundance of tables, nearly identical fields, and other complexities, I often give up trying to figure things out on my own and go directly to colleagues for direction.

My boss has been implying I should be more confident on my own at this point, so I can't help but wonder if he's right and I should be better at figuring things out on my own at this stage. I've also noticed a few colleagues who are also newer (although they have more background in data analysis) seem to be doing much better than me when it comes to working independently. They probably have 25% more requests completed than I do, with more made deadlines.

Typically, my workflow looks something like this:

1. Review the request.
2. Meet with the requestor to discuss further.
3. Explore the data and try to figure things out on my own.
4. When I get stuck for more than a few hours, I ask my colleagues to point me in the right direction (usually I try looking over different tables/fields, reviewing other analysts working, sitting on things to see if anything clicks).
5. I power through and continue working on it.
6. Once I believe I'm in a good place, I request peer review.
7. Finally, I work on finalizing and delivering the request.

Someone please give it to me straight. Is this my fault? Should I be doing better at this point? Should I spend some extra time after hours trying to learn our data infrastructure better?

I would greatly appreciate any advice or support you can all offer. Thank you all.  


Edit: Thank you all for the advice, encouragement, and kind words! It appears my hunch was correct; the challenges mostly stem from a dysfunctional work environment. Despite the struggles, I'll keep pushing forward and making the best of it.

I can read their code and analysis but I just feel isolated and would learn a lot more by actually interacting with them while working

Since joining have learned a lot more about ETL pipelines and cloud technologies, but honestly I’m not sure how much more I can learn here that I can’t learn in any other job.

I can do the work but I feel like I could be a lot more effective and efficient.

"Data Analyst job is, well - not data analysis at all",15ysbh8,"I'm about 5 weeks into a new role with a well known nonprofit. Prior, I was working as an analyst for a mid-size retailer on their ECommerce team - I was there for a little over a year (this is my only other work experience). Now, I took this role as fully remote (last role was hybrid), and was misled quite a bit in the interview process. I was led to believe that this role was going to be a bit more on the technical side, however I'm learning that isn't the case AT ALL. 

&#x200B;

This new role contains 0 actual data analysis. For starters, I'm the only analyst for this company, so I'm kind of on my own. When I took this job, I flat out told them I was looking for something more technical - in my last role I used some SQL, PowerBI. I was really looking to expand upon that. I have quickly come to realize that the entirety of my role is just responding to tickets and using Adobe Analytics. There is quite literally zero analysis work to be done. 

&#x200B;

I'm debating just outright quitting. Nothing makes me feel like I'm in hell more than just sitting there responding to tickets all day. To be clear - I was told that what I'm doing is essentially the job - there won't be expansion into more technical areas in the future. Quite honestly, I feel like I'm regressing by being here, and I feel like my technical skills especially may regress by not being able to utilize them in any way or expand upon them. Maybe I'd focus on getting my Master's, or finding something else - but am I crazy for considering quitting when I'm confident this is a dead-end job that will likely only harm my career more than help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15ysbh8/data_analyst_job_is_well_not_data_analysis_at_all/,MehDub11,69,Career,36,Top - year

Trapped in dev job after bait-and-switch,15dzi6j,"TL;DR: Took my first DS job, was moved to a software development team and now I'm stuck, because my current job doesn't give me the experience I need to move to the next DS gig.

So, I started my first job as a generalist DS ~1.5 yrs ago (following an unrelated PhD), but after ~6 mo, the company pulled a bait-and-switch and ""temporarily"" moved me to a software development project due to a ""shift in priorities"" and because I ""know Python"". 

Now it's been a year and I still find myself in a scrum team fixing bugs, adding features to our app or wireframing UIs. Naturally, I've been looking for a new DS position, but without much success, i.e. few take-homes or technical interviews.

The main hurdles, in my view, are that
• Interviewers get suspicious when they see that I've been at my current company for such a short amount of time,
• I've gained virtually no experience directly relevant to DS (only worked on a data pipeline / reporting project for the first few months).

To address the first issue, I usually give a canned response, when asked about my motivation to move. I would say that I've been working in a software development project because it creates the most value for the company at this time. That I really appreciate this experience because good development practices and cloud technologies are so important for modern DS workflows, but that I prefer working more hands-on with data to solve concrete problems for stakeholders. In my view, that's quite positive and logical, but maybe this could be improved?

The experience issue is harder to fix. The only way I see atm is to go back to doing personal projects and applying to entry-level jobs. Since I don't have the energy for this while working full time, I'd have to save up for a few months and then quit my current job. That carries a certain risk, but I'd bite the bullet for a chance at a job that's more up also.

Investing in Math Knowledge Better Than Learning Software Tooling for Career Longevity?,12scipk,"Had this discussion with coworker.

I tend to agree, and putting yourself in this mindset prevents the pressure to learn the flurry of trendy new tools as much.

How would you approach this interview question?,1b853sy,"So this was my first ""data science"" interview where I was asked (what I think) was a business case. Apparently I did soo poorly I got handed a rejection a few hours later, so I wanted to know what you guys think of this problem, how you would solve it, if it's even an appropriate DS question etc...

The problem goes something like this: You are a data scientist that works at an e-commerce platform that sells experiences at Paris (think bicycle rides, wine tours, etc...). The company doesn't own any products but rather takes a commission from every product sold.

You have access to a table of 500 such products (for Paris only) that has columns like title, category, review count, review avg, price, duration, when it was posted, etc... (maybe 2-3 more but these seem more like internal IDs that don't really matter). The three questions we went over before she gave up on me were:

1. How would you pick 1-2 metrics from this column to sort these listings? (To build a quick formula for ranking these listings)
2. What are some disadvantages of this approach?
3. How would you predict that the rankings will change in 6 months from today (assuming I implemented my strategy)?

My answers where:

1. I would pick the review avg and count. normalize the count, like minmax so that it is in the same range as the review avg, and weight the review count and review avg by a alpha and (1 - alpha) for example. Should have I picked price instead of review count? I didn't because I would assume that the revenue generated per product would be somewhat similar (I also asked how they take commission and the answer I got was to use price as the proxy for commission which imo makes no sense, the rates wouldn't be the same for all of the prices right?), otherwise they would not have signed that product plus, for longer term growth I would assume UX would be more important that money generated short term, i.e. recommend things that the user would like more... should have I used the inverse of the review count to treat this problem more like a multi armed bandit with the UCB strategy?
2. I said that this approach wouldn't give a higher ranking to newer products and that it would be more dificult for these new products to rank
3. I pretty much said the same as 2. because I also gave up around here

The questions I have are: why ask a question that doesn't allow me to use ML? I understand having a baseline, but still... I briefly mentioned multi armed bandits and she overlooked what I said. If this was a business case why didn't I get more context? I asked what was the bigger context, if this was for a ranking algorithm, and got a not very convincing ""sure"" (tbh using the term ""sort"" here somewhat confused me, I usually see the term ""ranking"" for these problems, it looked like she was avoiding it for some reason). I then asked what was their current approach for sorting these listings and she didn't answer...",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b853sy/how_would_you_approach_this_interview_question/,AromaticCantaloupe19,67,Discussion,64,Top - year

Data Science Salary vs GDP per Capita,1bo0qx0,"Naturally, GDP per capita has a strong correlation with the salary of any profession, including Data Scientists. It is interesting to see, however, which countries pay more than expected based on GDP. The United States not only pays the highest, but it seems to pay way more than the GDP would predict. My interpretation is that this is due to the many successful global companies in the US, which means that a single hour of DS work scales across many more users comparatively to average companies in other countries.

The basis for this chart are the predictions from the data science salary prediction model, performed only once for a given set of job's features (across all possible combinations of the job's features), to avoid the common mistake of just taking the average salary in the dataset for the analysis.

How should data science employees be evaluated?,17sjneh,"It is known that most of the data science initiatives fail. For most companies, the return on investment for data science teams is far lesser than a team of data analysts and data engineers working on a business problem. In some orgs, data scientists are now being seen as resource hoggers, some of who have extremely high salaries but haven't delivered anything worthwhile to make a business impact or even to support a business decision.

Other than a few organizations that have been successful in hiring the right talent and also fostering the right ecosystem for data science to flourish, it seems that most companies still lack data maturity. While all of the companies seem to have a ""vision"" to be data-driven, very few of them have an actual plan. In such organisations,  the leadership themselves do not know what problems they want to solve with data science. For the management it is an exercise to have a ""led a data team"" tag in their career profiles. 

The expectation is for the data scientists to find the problems themselves and solve them. Almost everytime, without a proper manager or an SME, the data scientists fail to grasp the business case correctly. Lack of business acumen and the pressure of leadership expectations to deliver on their skillsets, makes them model the problems incorrectly. They end up building low confidence solutions that stakeholders hardly use. Businesses then either go back to their trusted analysts for solutions or convert the data scientists into analysts to get the job done. 

The data scientists are expected to deliver business value, not PPTs and POCs, for the salary they get paid. And if they fail to justify their salaries, it becomes difficult for businesses to keep paying them. When push comes to shove, they're shown the door. 

Data scientists, who were once thought of as strategic hirings, are now slowly becoming expendables. And this isn't because of the market conditions. It is primarily because of the ROI of data scientists compared to other tech roles. And no, a PhD alone does not generate any business value, neither does leetcode grinding, nor does an all-green github profile of ready-made projects from an online certification course the employee completed to become job ready. 

But here's the problem for someone who has to balance between business requirements and a technical team - when evaluated on the basis of value generated, it does not bode well with the data science community in company, who feel that data science is primarily a research job and data scientists should be paid for only research, irrespective of the financial and productivity outcomes.

In such a scenario, how should a data scientist be evaluated for performance?

"Didn't get the job at an interview because of ""Mistakes made"" but can't find them.",14kip3b,"Hi, 2 YOE Data Scientist here, with Engineering Background.

I was doing a interview for a start-up in Paris. The project was looking great, the interviewer, a Talent Acquisition girl, was really nice.

At the end of the interview, she asked me 4 theoretical questions, in vocal, no notes or time to think.

*1) I throw a coin, call X the random variable of the result, which can take x=0 if heads and x=1 if tails. What is the mathematical law X follows ?*

My answer : Uniform law, with probability of p=1/n => p=1/2 here.

&#x200B;

*2) Now I call Y the random variable counting the number of times I get heads. What is the mathematical law Y follows ?*

My answer : Binomial law => succession of experiences with 2 outcomes.

&#x200B;

*3) You have a dataset with equal amounts of pictures of cats, dogs, and a third categories with all but cats and dogs, all in quantity sufficient to prevent issues. We build a model achieving 95% precision. But, when entering production, the precision collapses to 60%. What do you do to fix this ?*

My answer : I would take the data from production, and analyse both training and production datasets to look for statistical differences, labelization mistakes, or any property which could explain a difference (example : maybe all cats and dogs are black in the training one ?). I would also check the capacity of the model, look for any underfitting or overfitting issue, by looking at the loss of the model on seen and unseen data.  I would also make sure data was shuffled properly, just in case.

Other things to do would be to check confusion matrixes to help identify the cases of the errors.

*4) Give me key indicators of performance in data science.*

For neural networks construction, training precision/loss, validation precision/loss, testing precision/loss, but also statistical indicators like RSE, RMSE, MAPE... and the dozen of similar metrics. Each of those metrics have different use case, for example RMSE is good for low values in dataset, but bad for high values or outliers.

&#x200B;

4 days later, I received an email telling eventhough the interview was pleasant and my career impressive, I made mistakes on those questions which made them decide to not continue the hiring process with me. I was very surprised, and still can't fully understand which answers were wrong. It's very frustrating because it's very hard to get any interview for junior datascientists positions where I am, such opportunities are rare. I want to understand my mistakes and improve to not let this happen again. Can you guys give me your opinions on this ?

Thanks in advance !  


EDIT : Thanks a lot for all your feedback. I have now a clearer picture on how I could improve things.

My experience transitioning from full-time to freelancing,13xabtx,"I was scrolling through this sub yesterday and saw a couple of posts related to what i recently went through - lay offs and freelancing. so thought i'd create a separate detailed post on how i got started freelancing and why not get back into FTE (if interested, see related post back in Jan just after getting laid off- [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ivzyj/my\_ds\_experience\_at\_amazon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ivzyj/my_ds_experience_at_amazon/)).

Anyway, after my last FT job at Amazon, and having the luxury of not needing to jump back into the job market immediately, I had to choose between getting back to stable employment or exploring few things i had wanted to try out for a while now- freelancing and learning web development.

Even with FTE, I had tried working on side projects on evenings/weekends after regular work hours, but with Amazon, ""regular work hours"" is a blurry line. and my projects never really got anywhere. January was also the time when chatGPT was getting popular and I had been playing around with chat-with-your-data apps using the openai LLMs. So on a whim, even before deciding anything, I created an Upwork profile. Mostly, I wanted to prove to myself that i could make money if i needed to without selling away all my time to a company.

I reached out to a couple of folks on Upwork who needed help with AI chatbots, and to my surprise, within a couple of weeks, i had my first freelancing gig and soon after (thanks to the upwork algorithm), started getting jobs in my inbox. So much so that I could select what jobs i wanted to work on. Just last week, I declined a $10k contract offer just for the first phase as the client had been dragging their feet since March with ""approvals"" and the scope was unclear. I had to remind myself that i didn't want to get into another long contract which would effectively be full time employment.

Since Feb, I have made $15k on Upwork without really 'applying' for any of them (all inbound requests), while being highly selective on how much time i freelance and what kind of work i want to do. I know $15k is nothing to brag about compared to a salary, but I share this as someone who 4 months back, thought freelancing was a non-option for me. To the person who asked about this yesterday, it's very doable.

So what have I been doing with the rest of my time? Spending time with my now 6-month son, traveling, and learning web development. Work-wise, I wanted to reconnect with fellow data scientists, so tried running a data science mentoring/mock interview group here but that never really took off ([https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10uy2qi/starting\_a\_personalized\_mentorship\_group\_for\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10uy2qi/starting_a_personalized_mentorship_group_for_data/)).  So instead, I combined it with my other interest to learn web development and have built a data science mock interview app - [rightjoin.co](https://rightjoin.co). here is a short blurb-

* get mock interviewed with an AI hiring manager for any company/job post/topic of choice. Warm up for your upcoming interview with questions tailored to the job posting/topic.
* you can upload your resume and have your AI persona answer questions for you. so you get to observe how your chatGPT-version would answer questions.
* get feedback on each response to the interviewer questions

Its currently a ""phone-screen"" level interview, but i plan adding other types of interview rounds if people find this useful. And its free. please try out and let me know what you think, especially if you have an upcoming interview. here's a screenshot:

For me, it's been fun dabbling with web development (django, htmx), keeping up with AI wave, having the freedom to spend time with family when i feel like, and learn things that interest me. I know this may not be sustainable, but I do plan to ramp up freelancing later this year if needed to stress test that option, and only in the worst case, jump back into the job market.

I understand, these options may not be viable for others, but if you do find yourself having to make additional income with freelancing or want to try out solopreneurship, it's possible. Obviously there is risk involved but also ways to manage that risk until your build your portfolio a little. the AI wave has made this easier than otherwise, but as a data scientist, why wouldn't you jump on this wave?

DS Professionalism: Notebook best practices,17y72e7,"We all know that in general notebooks are the standard for many data science teams and that they can lead to bad practise (notebooks that can’t be run top to bottom, functions that change definition etc.).


Are there any resources for what best design practice looks like for notebook lead DS for the sake of clear and repeatable analysis/modeling. 


For example:

1. Should non-package functions be defined in notebooks or imported from a separate .py.

2. Handling data imports (all at the top or only for each separate piece of analysis)

3. When to separate notebooks (eg for a model training task would you have data pulling, cleaning, validation, hyper parameter tuning, final training, out-of-sample checks all in one notebook or a folder that contains X ordered notebooks to do those tasks.)



The obvious answer is “do what your team does”, but in case you are in charge of practise or there is no design doc for the team are there good defaults.

Importance of CS fundamentals for data science roles in tech,17qql6b,"How important are computer science (CS) fundamentals to data science roles   at tech companies? And how central are they to the application  process?

Tech companies like  Google, Meta, and Amazon offer public resources to help  job candidates understand work life and required skills. These resources  often  describe cross-functional teams of engineers, data scientists,  etc.  Advertised roles like ""machine learning engineer"" also seem to  inhabit  the gray area between software development engineer (SDE) and  data  scientist. Of course, these companies offer tech products at huge scale, and at least for SDEs, CS knowledge is a focus.

However,   many data science learning materials focus on the math and techniques for analyzing data and building models, with programming as essentially a  means to those ends.

As  someone  interested in exploring tech, I am wondering if formal study of  data  structures, algorithms, computational complexity, etc., should be  a  bigger part of my diet.

I appreciate your answers. It's helpful to know your connection to this topic too (e.g., recruiter, team member, fellow candidate).

**EDIT:** I take it for granted that folks need to know how to write maintainable code and use programing tools like git, unit tests, etc. By CS fundamentals I am thinking of concepts or design patterns that enable software to scale efficiently. Thanks for clarifying questions.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for all the input. To summarize several great comments drawing from individual professional experience:

> Data Scientists (DS) and ML Engineers (MLE) need different skills; generally these roles are not interchangeable. Large companies may be able to specialize so that DS focus on models and collaborate with MLE for scaling. Smaller companies may have more generalists. CS knowledge requirements may also vary by different areas of a company (e.g., product vs engineering).
>
> A DS with CS knowledge may collaborate better and enjoy more career mobility. However, entry level DS can generally begin with rudimentary CS knowledge and grow on the job.

Couple follow-ups for those who want more:

- The hiring guides I mention focus more on SDE. Seen any good ones for DS?
- I feel like I see more MLE than DS reqs. How does demand compare?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17qql6b/importance_of_cs_fundamentals_for_data_science/,chiqui-bee,61,Career Discussion,26,Top - year

"Where to go after studying the foundations of linear algebra, calculus, probability theory and statistics?",1b0mae5,"So Ihave been studying these topics for 4.5 months, using a mix of Pearson's Jon Krohn's live lessions and bluebrown channel on YouTube.

And I learned some great foundations about what happens in machine learning algorithms in terms of data structures and matricies operations and in optimizing parameters in functions using gradient descent, backed up with probability theory and statistical tests.


Where should I go now? I asked 6 months ago about a book here called hands on machine learning. Read it and got to work with sklearn on supervised learning problems at work (I am a sales operations analyst with 1.5 years of experience and another year of internships in multiple companies as a data analyst)

My goal is applying for a junior DS role. So, given what I studied, where should I go from here on? What should I study and train on to be able to work as a junior data scientist?

I am good at python, sql, powerBI, DAX, tableau, Excel if you need to know where my tech stack is.

What model should I use? Predicting if a client would like a song or not.,15i6i1u,"Hi all,

I changed some details to make the question clearer, but it goes as follows:

Client enter our website, we have all kind of features (browser, language, age, location, etc.), and we present them with a song. There are currently 10 songs in our system to choose from. They can either click ""like"", ""dislike"" or not give feedback at all.

The goal is to maximize the probability that a client would enjoy the song, by matching a song based on the info we have on the user (the features I mentioned before).

Intuitively I was thinking of a multiclass classifier, but I have only like/dislike (or no feedback) for one song per user (assume I don't know who the user is, I treat each observation as independent).

Another way is to create an XGBOOST for each one of the 10 songs, and in real-time choose the song with the highest prediction. It'd work but it sounds ""dumb"", as there is a much better, known way, to deal with it.

This really feels good especially considering I flunked out of grad school the first time I tried going from 2015-2017.

UPDATE: it’s been almost a year since I made this post and a few people have reached out about the program so I thought I’d make an update. 

I did not end up enrolling in the program. I enrolled in WGU’s Master of Data Analytics program. Say what you will about competency based education, but the application process was free and was easy to complete. I applied in September and enrolled on 10/1/23. I graduated earlier this month with a 30 day extension given to me since I was in my final capstone course.

I now have a masters that only cost a total of $4,470, took 6 months to finish, and helped me land my current position 3 months ago which was a big step up for me. It’s already paid itself off so I’m super happy with my choice. I also have close to a decade of work experience in the data field so at this point all I needed was that piece of paper saying I had a masters. After listing my masters as “in progress” on my resume I started getting a ton of interview opportunities and went multiple rounds with 3 employers, got 2 offers, and settled on the best one before the 3rd one could get back to me.

What realistically is a good alternative take-home assignments?,18aif1a,"Everyone in this sub seems to absolutely hate take-home assignments. I used to find it stupid as well until I was involved in a hiring process a few months back.

We were hiring for a junior to mid level DS position, it only took a couple of days to gather half a thousand applications. (It’s absolutely insane, maybe due to the job being remote) Even after filtering out those with quantitative degrees or relevant experience, we still had to deal with slightly over 100 candidates. Interview all of them is definitely out of the question here.

The process we had was to get them do a coding test. Easy to medium leetcode questions with some SQL questions. Of the 2/3 that passed, we send them an assignment with one week deadline. Once submitted, they get a zoom interview to present their work. Here’s the thing, **take-home assignments work.** It very effectively cut down the number of applicants to around 10. 

I understand it’s not fun doing these assignments, but given the job market, what’s a good alternative that helps you filter among 100s of qualified candidates on paper, and also help you understand how they do their work and communicate? DS resumes these days all look the same. Everyone claims to know everything with no proof of proficiency. Recruiting is very time consuming and costly, and the cost of hiring a fraud DS costs even more.

Some argue that assignments will deter the best candidates from continuing the application. The reality is that, unless it’s meta or google, employers are not obsessed with finding the best person out of hundreds of candidates. They just want to find someone who is **good enough** to perform certain tasks without adding burden to the team. 

So for those really hates take-home assignments, if you’re in the position of hiring, how will you evaluate your applicants?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/18aif1a/what_realistically_is_a_good_alternative_takehome/,supper_ham,57,Career Discussion,126,Top - year

My job is producing loads of charts for Powerpoint...,166p30n,"I've started a new job in a industry company. 

Basically, my department does market analysis. They've been doing it for years and everything is a big Excel file. Everything is excel and kind of a mess. For more info about the context, here the [episode 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1271cb2/new_job_as_a_data_manager_the_data_is_a_bunch_of/) of my adventures.

So, I've had to build from scratch some kind of data *stack*. Currently it is :

* A postgresql database
* Jupyter environment

To be honest, I was skeptical about Jupyter because it shouldn't be a production jack-of-all-trades-data-tools. But so far so good.

I'm fairly experienced in SQL, Python (for data analysis: pandas, numpy). 

Here is my question. A huge part of the job is producing charts and graphs and so on. **The most typical case is producing one chart and doing 10 variations of it**. Basically for each business line. So, it's just a matter a filtering there and there and that's it. 

Before, everything was done in Excel. And kind of a pain, because you had a bunch of sheets and pivot tables and then the charts. You clicked update and everything went to shit because Excel freaks out if the context moves a tiny bit, etc. It was almost impossible to maintain consistency with colors, etc. So... not ideal. And on top of that, people had to draw by hand square and things on top of the charts because there are no ways to do it in Excel.

My solution for that is... Doing it in Python... And I don't know if it's a good idea. I'm self taught and has no idea if there are more proper way to produce charts for print/presentations. Main motivation was: ""I can get Python working fast, I really want to practice it more""

My approach is:

- If I have to produce a report, that is like 30 charts and they all have 5 variations. I build a notebook for this purpose. 
- In the notebook I try to make everything nice and tidy by using parameters and functions a lot (and comments, and text blocks with explanations for future-me). I try to pull data once (SQL) and keep it as a dataframe, manipulate it with Pandas and do the chart with Matplotlib. Each chart is a function and variations are handled by passing a parameters. And styling, etc. Is done by calling a module I've made.

For example, I want to produce the the bar chart `P3G2_B1`. It's the Graph #2 on page #3 for Business line #1. 

I call the function `P3G2()` with B1 as parameters and it produces the desired chart. With proper styling (Title, proper stylesheet, and a footer mentioning the chart id and the date). It's saved as a SVG (P3G2_B1.svg) and later converted to .EMF (because my company uses an old version of PPT that doesn't support SVG.

So far, what is good about this approach :

- The charts look nice and are very visually consistent. Matplotlib allows me to specify a lot of things so there are few surprises.
- It's fast enough. Doing an update and outputing 50 charts is a matter of minutes.

What I'm not too happy about :

- Matplotlib makes me miserable. I'm still learning Python and everything is painful. I find matplotlib confusing as hell. There are multiples and wildly different ways to do anything. Half of my days are just googling ""How to so <insert weird request> in matplotlib"". I've tried seaborn, plain pandas, and so on that are supposed to be *easier* than pure matplotlib. Well, I end up having to do something weird and having to sprinkle it with plain old matplotlib regardless. So I've decided to just go with it.
- Matplotlib to do print is quite awful. My powerpoint slides have a grid, and let's say I want to create a bar chart that is 8 by 6 on this grid. So I expect a 800x600 pixels image. Not. so. easy. (especially since I need space for title and footer around the chart). What you see and not always what you get (through savefig, as an image file). My module handles that mostly OK but it's very hacky and still a mess. And also, the .svg to .emf conversion is another layer of pain. Some graphical things don't convert well (hatches for example).
- Some charts functions are more than 100 hundreds lines of code. It scares me a bit. I have a hard time convincing people that it is better than Excel. They just see a house of cards waiting to fall.

So. Given the assignment, am I crazy to go with Python notebooks?

* Current systems can’t scale, be extended and are narrow in scope. They are badly engineered.
* Because of the above, I am building a scalable system, step by step
* I have some questions about how best to do it

# My current thinking and the state of the project

&#x200B;

* Should I create a formal scale of usability of the AI projects? I am looking for your input here.
* I think I should improve model consistency, extends the model with custom domain knowledge, and make an early attempt to build simple user agents in the domain. Backend + API? SNS/SQS + API+ Backend\*
* What I have is a schema inference, contracting basics, and a way to structure unstructured data. *Ideas on structuring data contracts? Schema evolution?*
* I’m about to create a memory component that manages the data stored in vector DBs, as a DWH for AI.
* If I bring this use case that was not something available easily to the public before, how best do it?

I would love to get your feedback!

What do you do when data quality is bad?,16ra88t," I've been assigned an AI/ML project, and I've identified that the data quality is not good.

First job fresh out of Uni and none of my skills can be used,1682utu,"So I just graduated from University 2 months ago, and focused on building my skills in data science taking the required courses in Statistics, Machine Learning, Biologically Inspired Computations, and am decent in using Python, SQL, R. With the mindset of breaking into the industry as an Analyst, I spent the entire of the last semester and these two months job hunting. Was met with countless rejections and failed interviews and finally landed a role at a startup as a Data Analyst.

The company had actually just started operations 6 months prior, so I did not have much data to work with. Essentially, most of my time was spent in doing data entry, cleaning their excel sheets, updating their CRM with the cleaned data and creating some Power BI reports. I was recently browsing on LinkedIn and came across Data Analyst Job postings with descriptions that talked about skills in building data pipelines, bringing together data in a data warehouse, manipulating datasets in production environments, technologies and dbs such as Snowplow, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Neo4j, and just felt so inadequate. Not only do I have no idea where to start, I am also losing knowledge of the ML, Statistics and coding skills I had in college. I do not have any senior at work who has done anything remotely in my field to seek advice from, and just answer to the Business Manager.

Are there any books, websites, YouTube channels, or courses I could pursue in my weekends or free time to learn and develop these skills? I am very thankful I even have a job in this environment, but I fear being behind my peers and having no technical skills in the future at this rate. I don't even mind starting from the very beginning (How to be a Data Analyst/ Data Scientist? Learning Statistics from the basics, etc etc.) to polish my knowledge of this field. I just wanna be in a position where I can vouch for myself and my knowledge when leaving this company for a more competitive environment that actually matches DS.

Description: 
- Develop some magical AI that solves all our business problems using all sorts of buzzwords we hear in the news
- Develop LLMs that has nothing to do with the business
- There are cavern walls in Africa with cravings by Neanderthals containing cleaner data than the database

Requirements: 
- 2 PhDs
- Published 7 first author papers in top journals
- Won 5 Kaggle competitions simultaneously with one model

**2. The ML engineer**
Description: 
- Literally everything from data eng to MLOps to cloud infra, except actual data science
- “End-to-end ML pipeline”
- If you use a for loop with pandas data frame, they will bring you to the back alley and shoot you in the head

Requirements: 
- Solve hard leetcode question blindfolded with one arm behind your back
- Need to know 17 ways to accomplish the exact same thing using AWS/GCP
- Need to know 5 different databases we don’t even use

**3. The mislabelled data analyst**
Description: 
- Nothing but making dashboards
- Use statistics but not too much that it gives our execs imposter syndrome
- ML, but it’s logistic regression on Excel

Requirements: 
- Tableau etc
- Telepathic ability to magically make business people understand basic statistics concepts 
- Willing to be called incompetent by exec when your analysis shows the source of all business problems stemmed from poor management by said exec

Starting my own analytics engineering team- give up or die trying?,16cusds,"I'm currently a year into being a part of a small analytics team at a large and antiquated retail company. My manager and teammates are completely business-facing with minimal technical knowledge. Speaking to some higher ups and other functional teams, I realize there's a huge cap in data needs and people who can manage simple data workflow, such as getting the data, cleaning & exporting it, and creating dashboards.

Our leadership is not open to hiring additional senior level data folks, so I guess it's up to me to do the job if I choose to. My question is, is it worth the effort to start my own team and build an entire infrastructure from the ground up?

I've helped them automated all of the data transformation steps with Python and built some nifty dashboards for our stakeholders. 

What would be the tools & costs associated with building a completely new infra?

Stuff I can think of: (we're of course a MS Windows shop)

* A database (ex. MS SQL server on Azure)
* An orchestrating tool (Airflow/Prefect)
* Github
* Tableau (we already have)
* Additional headcount (I will be a one-man team to start. I don't have huge ambitions to be a people manager.

"The search for intellectual stimulation in DS jobs, should I just give up?",1478u33,"I’m an MS student in statistics. My undergrad was in mathematics and statistics. I have done a few data science internships in undergrad. These were analytics jobs, and, frankly, I shared the same sentiment with a lot of people here about them being dull, boring, and not challenging. 

The rigor of my undergraduate and graduate degree made me search for jobs that were just as rigorous, and, I was surprised after a few of these internships that, this is just how the industry is.

I felt very lost in my career search despite having the technical background. I considered various career paths

 (quant finance), can’t get an interview unless I got a top Ivy League degree and get screened out regardless of my credentials. 

(Machine learning engineer) I have no software engineering experience, and seeing as my prior experience is data analysis tools like R and python I haven’t gotten any interviews for this since I just don’t fit the description of a software engineer (which is what they seem to want for these roles)


(PhD in Statistics) this is not a career path obviously, but, I figured well, maybe I should apply to phd programs and just do academic research. I get the rigor from undergrad (and more) plus working on technical and challenging research problems. And of course having a PhD can open more doors. But the thing holding me back for this is I’m graduating from my MS at 24 years old, and by the time I finish a PhD I’d be 29-30. Put a lot of my life on hold, and frankly, as much as I thought research is interesting and I love statistical theory, I’m just not a huge fan of the academic lifestyle and reminds me of school.



I reached out to one of my former managers at a prior data science internship. He did his BS in mathematics and MS in economics and went from modeling roles -> analytics. 

I asked him why he did this, and why he didn’t wish to stay in the technical role he was in at first. 

What he told me frankly shocked me. He said that at his company 

- modelers have worse work life balance than data scientists in analytics

- data scientists in analytics have much higher pay than modelers do to them being closer to the business 


He told me that ultimately the WLB and higher pay is what motivated him to go to analytics. He told me a job is a job at the end of the day, and he couldn’t justify doing more technical work for less pay. 

So I guess I wanted to ask you guys, even if some of you guys don’t enjoy your SQL/Tableau analytics jobs. Do you still stick around cause of the high pay?

"As a new grad, is getting a masters an inevitability that I need to plan around",1awqhei,"As a new grad, is getting a masters an inevitability that I need to plan for

As a new grad, can someone clarify just how necessary a masters is and should I start planning to get one now?

Graduating this May with a Bachelors in Applied Math from a top 10 university. Degree has been pretty much the intro math stuff (Calc2&3, Linear Algebra) the 2 first years and Stats/CS/mathematical modeling last 2 years. I have a job lined up already as an L2 analyst at a company I’ve been interning at for the past 2 years. 

I’ve been researching around for more info on just how necessary a masters is in the field and if it’s something I’m going to eventually need to bite the bullet on. Currently, as I understand it, people tend to get caught up in chasing data scientist as a title (which is inherently a senior position) when analyst positions are the more entry level roles. So is it reasonable to assume that analyst for a few years -> DS is a valid path or would I still eventually run into that wall of needing an advanced degree no matter what?

I don’t really want to go through the process of getting a masters. I’m lucky enough to be graduating with no debt and am not really eager to voluntarily get it. The idea of taking 2 years off from making money is not very attractive as well. Also, part of me is just talking as a senior who’s tired of school so there’s that.

I myself would not hire an experienced DS nor a DA without domain knowledge, despite all their flashy online certificates and degrees.

Their idea is to bring in intermediaries to do the translation of business needs. Some of the teams who've been in the org for a long time see this as only an image building exercise of creating a new verticle. To shut the naysayers' mouths they've hired DS consultants to do the talking on a technical front.

"Laid off, being offered a contracting position, need advice",18c5bjn,"Last Friday I was laid off on a group call with 5 other people. I worked for a small company and they basically ran out of money and are shutting down our entire half of the business besides 2-3 people (almost 30 people were laid off I believe).

An hour after the call, my boss called me (he’s been there for 25 years and is staying) saying that he has no one else who can handle large data sets and he didn’t know what he would do if they received customer leads and needed data help. I was the only person doing analytics on the entire team. He said they are now going to offer me a contracting position to help as needed. 

What can I expect from the contracting offer? Any advice on whether to accept it or not, or a threshold at which I should accept/deny?

Also, I have two previous bosses from this company and both were able to set up interviews for me at their current companies. I had an initial screen at the first one yesterday and it seemed horrendous - I would really prefer not to work there but I know I can’t be picky. The guy was demeaning (“why did you choose to go for your master’s in analytics?” - as if he didn’t even understand what analytics is), but said if he decides to take a certain project, I would be a good fit. I’m more hopeful for the second company as it seems like a less toxic environment and I have specific experience in that industry, but I don’t have an interview scheduled there yet.

Glass ceiling for data science careers?,1467419,"I am working with many data scientists in a large international enterprise, many of them have a PhD in fields such as physics, maths or computer science.

Recently, I started wondering if there exists an unspoken glass ceiling for data scientists (or IT specialists in general) in many organisations for such individuals who are not overly keen on giving up actual hands-on data science work, or who are not overly keen on having lunches and coffees with more senior managers all the time. This might sound like a luxury problem to have, but once you are beyond your 40s and have a family, it's not so much fun to be put in front of an undisclosed choice to either not progress anymore significantly or be forced to become a manager and give up that which you are really good at. Obviously, one could argue that many data scientists, to progress further, need to learn how to be more outgoing, extrovert, present themselves etc. - but that's not what I'm referring to. I've seen brilliant people leave the company because there was just not a lot more possible for the positions they were in.

Why can't I transform a distribution by deducting one from all counts?,18p8uz5," Suppose I have records of the number of fishes that each fisherman caught from a particular lake within the year. The distribution peaks at count = 1 (i.e. most fishermen caught just one fish from the lake in the year), tapers off after that, and has a long right-tail (a very small number of fishermen caught over 100 fishes).

Such a data could possibly fit either a Poisson Distribution or a Negative Binomial Distribution. However, both of these distributions have a non-zero probability at count = 0, whereas for our data, fishermen who caught no fishes were not captured as a data point.

Why is it not correct to transform our original data by just deducting 1 from all counts, and therefore shifting our distribution to the left by 1 such that there is now a non-zero probability at count = 0?

(Context: this question came up to me during an interview for a data science job. The interviewer asked me how to deal with the non-zero probability at count = 0 for poisson or negative binomial distribution, and I suggested transforming the data by deducting 1 from all counts which apparently was wrong. I think the correct answer to how to deal with the absence of count = 0 is to use a zero-trauncated distribution instead)",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/18p8uz5/why_cant_i_transform_a_distribution_by_deducting/,wanderingcatto,55,Statistics,28,Top - year

It is difficult enough to land any interviews at all rn, but then you have to deal with the recruiters who cannot even do their jobs. I recently had a negative experience with Capital One for a data science position. Details are below:

* I was reached out by a recruiter from C1 about 2 weeks ago, asking for my availability for a 30 mins interview. I responded within that day my availability for that week and the week after.
* Recruiter responded 5 days later, agreeing to schedule a call at 3PM the day after
* The day after, recruiter sent me an email right before the call, saying that he needed to push back the call to the next day. I agreed and provided him with my availability for that day. Recruiter did not send any confirmation response.
* The day after that, recruiter emailed me at 2:40PM, asking me if he could call at 3PM. I was in a meeting at the time, but still agreed to take the call and left the meeting early.
* Recruiter never called at 3PM. He sent an email at 4:30PM stating that “something came up that was very time-sensitive,” without any apology, and offered to reschedule for 6 PM that day or the next day. Again, I replied with an agreement to take the call at 6PM
* Recruiter never called at 6PM.
* The next day, I sent another email to recruiter, but this time, I copied Capital One's main careers/HR email address. He called me within a minute after I sent the email (lol).
* The call lasted for 5 mins, for what was supposed to be a 30 mins call. He asked me basic questions like salary expectations, and relocation. I was not even asked ""Do you have any other questions about this role?""
* Recruiter said he would forward my resume to 2 hiring managers, and would let me know what they think. I asked for the hiring manager's names, and he said he would send me their linkedin profiles in a follow-up email.
* Of course, I never received this follow-up email. I sent him an email asking for the hiring managers' contact info. He never replied.
* Early morning the next day, I received a rejection email. Mind you, our call was around 5PM the previous day. This made me wonder whether my resume was ever forwarded to the hiring managers at all.

TL,DR: Was flaked on 3 times by C1's recruiter. Finally got a super brief call because I copied the main HR email address in the chain. Got rejected the next day.

I’ve gone debt free for my education my whole life (thank you parents for bachelors, and thank you to myself for getting funding for my masters), but in no way do I want to pay for an MBA. 

From my limited experience it feels like MBAs are just degrees people get to prove to a higher up that they have the credential to get a c suite position. Cause ultimately people hire people and if the directors or c suites have MBAs they know if they have an MBA from xyz university then they are gonna get hired cause of it. 

What do you guys think, is education after my MS in stats necessary? I mean for me “education” post Masters degree is just reading advanced stats textbooks on my own for fun, whether I need to learn something for work or I’m just studying it for my enjoyment. But is a formal “degree” required? Like I don’t really see the point in me doing a PhD in stats, because I just don’t want to work in an academic setting and frankly I just want money more. 

Is there a natural cap with a MS in something technical (stats) for example?

How would you store/archive this project?
Committing Jupyter notebooks to a repo? Now you have bunch of html in your codebase. Code that’s impossible to pull request/review that also bloats the repo. If you clear the outputs of the notebook to reduce the notebook size it instantly becomes useless for later review because now you have to run it again to see what was it about. If you need to run it again you need the exact same data. Now you need to store the data snippet somewhere. Where do you store that data snipped for future reproducibility?

I keep hearning notebooks are great for experiments but I don’t see what the workflow is like for these experiments…

How to validate data?,173broc,"I'm an SWE (**not a data scientist**) and trying to build a generic data validation tool (or find appropriate tools to adopt) for my company.

I started looking into libraries such as Great Expectations, Pydantic, etc.. And they all seem promising, but I don't think they solve the issue of validating *changes in data* (as far as I can tell). They seem to be good at validating that data is within an expected range, of an expected type, etc., but I need a little more.

What I'm looking for is a tool that validates changes in data by comparing the previous value with the new value.

In some of our applications, new data is first pumped into a staging table. We then calculate relative change % between the staging and target table (for each field), and if the change is higher than some threshold, validation fails. But there's obviously a lot of issues with this (like in cases where a change from 1 to 18 is normal but produces a percent change of 1700).

This is just an example, but it would be helpful if we can call an API to do this sort of validation for us.

And instead of using absolute change, relative change, etc... is there perhaps a tool that can validate based on historical changes? Perhaps by capturing changes for some set time and using that information to validate future changes? I'm just brainstorming here.

Would highly appreciate some recommendations/tips for tackling this problem. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/173broc/how_to_validate_data/,Sensitive-Main-6700,52,Discussion,26,Top - year

Feature Selection from 300+ features,13rp23u,"Hi, I have a dataset with 80k+ rows and 300+ columns. Its a tabular data set and is a regression problem. It takes historic data and performances to predict the outcome. Though the original features are only about 50-70, I have a good understanding of the features and know they could be broken down a lot better to help the algorithm ( Xgboost most probably) give better results by creating new features. So i did a lot of feature creation, ratios, multiplications, ^ and so on. I feel like there could be unimportant features but there are some combinations which could really help my model.

There could be a mix of linear and non linear features, features having the same latent concepts as well. There are many ways like using tree based models, feature importance, neural nets, mutual info, correlation, RFE, selectkbest, information gain , forward and backward selection and many more. 

But, im confused because for eg, trees and neural nets can sometimes ignore a lot of the more nuanced features and go for the more obvious relationships and even thyre non linear, we dont have to remove the colinear features we might still get a case where the similar features will steal each other’s importance. 

So, there’s a lot to it and i know very less.

I'm getting bored of plotly and the usual options. Is there anything new and fancy?,1abyujr,"I was pretty excited to use plotly for the first year or two.  I had been using either matplotlib (ugh) or ggplot, and it was exciting to include some interactivity to my plots which I hadn't been able to before.  

But as some time has passed, I find the syntax cumbersome without any real improvements, and the plots look ugly out-of-the-box.  The colors are too ""primary"", the control box gets in the way, selecting fields on the legend is usually impractical, and it's always zooming in when I don't intend to.  Yes, these things can be changed, but it's just not an inspiring or elegant package.  

ggplot is still elegant to me and I enjoy using it, but it doesn't seem to be adding any features for interactivity or even tooltips which is disappointing.  

I sometimes get the itch to learn D3.js  [D3 by Observable | The JavaScript library for bespoke data visualization (d3js.org)](https://d3js.org/) or echarts  [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) .  The plots look amazing and a whole level above anything I've seen for R or Py, but when I look at the examples, it's staggering how many lines of JS code it takes to make a single plot, and I'm sure it's a headache to link it together with R / Py.  

Am I missing anything?  Does anyone else feel the same way?  Did anyone take the plunge into data viz with JS?  How did it work out?

how can I build a regression model which is penalised for moving away from an assumed set of coefficients?,12ijw84,"So I've a glm currently live, and i'm looking to refresh this model on latest data to capture any major drift in trends. I'm looking for a way of refreshing this model, but with a penalty factor included so that the fit is strongly discouraged from moving a coefficient, unless there's a clear gain to it (in other words, the model shouldn't pick up very minor variations, and certainly shouldn't flip signs of coefficients due to any correlation in the input data for example). Ideally the strength of the penalty should be a parameter the user can fiddle with to decide a best model.

&#x200B;

I have a number of ideas of how to do this: 

bayesian regression, with priors set to be equal to the original model coefs  ( think this will be too slow on large datasets though) 

Custom loss function, with a penalisation parameter similar to lasso regression which penalises a value different from the live model parameter (this will require a fair bit of coding and testing to get right though)

My main issue  is time constraints, so I'm wondering what the best out of the box tool i could use to achieve any of these, or if anyone knows of a simpler way of solving the problem.

It's time for me to move on to a new job but I'm intimidated by the current market,15kscb5,"I'm a healthcare data professional with six years of experience outside of tech, not sure what next step to take in my career. I have a healthcare degree and a masters heavy in biostatistics at this point.

The good thing is I have some down time and capitalized on that to learn more skills to compliment my experience, but now as I'm wrapping up some courses, I feel the best way for me to move forward would be to actually get a job more relevant to what I want to do.

Help with Multiple Linear Regression for product cannibalization.,1but6uu,"I briefly studied this in college, and chat gpt has been very helpful, but I’m completely out of my depth and could really use your help. 

 We’re a master distributor that sells to all major US retailers. 

I’m trying to figure out if a new product is cannibalizing the sales of a very similar product. 

I’m using multiple linear regression. 

Is this the wrong approach entirely?

Data base: Walmart year- Week as integer (higher means more recent), Units Sold Old Product , Avg. Price of old product, Total Points of Sale of Old Product where new product has been introduced to adjust for more/less distribution, and finally, unit sales of new product. 

So everything is aggregated at a weekly level, and at a product level. I’m not sure if I need to create dummy variables for the week of the year.

The points of sale are also aggregated to show total points of sale per week instead of having the sales per store per week. Should I create dummy variables for this as well?

I’m analyzing only the stores where the new product has been introduced. Is this wrong?

I’m normalizing all of the independent variables, is this wrong? Should I normalize everything? Or nothing?

My R^2 is about 15-30% which is what’s freaking me out.  I’m about to just admit defeat because the statistical “tests” chatgpt recommended all indicate linear regression just aint it bud. 

The coefficients make sense (more price less sales), more points of sale more sales, more sale of new product less sale of old.

My understanding is that the tests are measuring how well it’s forecasting sales, but for my case I simply need to analyze the historical relationship between the variables. Is this the right way of looking at it? 

Edit: Just ran mode with no normalization and got an R2 of 51%. I think Chat Gpt started smoking something along the process that just ruined the entire code. Product doesn’t seem to be cannibalizing, seems just extremely price sensitive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1but6uu/help_with_multiple_linear_regression_for_product/,realbigflavor,44,Analysis,26,Top - year

Tips for communicating with non-technical stakeholders,1bfge3g,"I think it’s fair to say that one of the key aspects of a lot (most) DA/DS roles is the ability to communicating results and technical ideas with non-technical stakeholders. 

I’m really interested to know what everybody here thinks that actually means in practice.

To me, it means:

* When presenting (e.g. slides), using concise key points, and graphs/charts that aren’t overwhelming, keep different colours to a minimum etc.

* Using language which adds more “relatability”. So rather than saying e.g. “17% of people”, saying “around 1 in 6 people”

* When talking about “raw data”, I like to be very clear about what each row represents in the context of what I’m looking at. Related to this - when you’ve aggregated or processed data, show an example of the raw data prior to aggregating to demonstrate exactly what you’ve done, to add context.

* Don’t say “we fit a linear regression model to the data by solving for the coefficients which minimise sum of the squared residuals” - instead, put it in plain English,  say “this is a mathematical model which predicts the value of Y based on X. We have used the data to determine the slope and intercept of a line which best fits the data”

Job offer (mini rant),15h58oo,"Hi people of reddit,

I have been looking for a job as a Data Scientist for the last year or so. In the meantime, I have been taking up some freelance work and classes on the side (dataquest, datacamp) to improve my skills.

For context, I am a Mathematician, and graduated from my Ph.D. a few years back. I finished my post-doc last August. I know how to write code in R, SQL and Python, and I am confident (most of the time) in my ability to learn. I am very familiar with statistical concepts (although I did not specialise in it) and I have exposure to ML algorithms. Over the last year or so, I have applied for over 500 roles, getting into \~50 interviews. In the end, I got exactly 2 offers, one of which I accepted a few days ago.

I have to say that this last year has been crappy (to say the least). Every company boasts about its inclusivity plan, which (don't get me wrong) is very much needed. However, my point here is that people with a background in academia are generally, and from my own experience, not included at all.

Some doctorate programmes have seminars that aim to ease the hypothetical transition to the industry, while, in truth it should be the other way around. As a former academic, I do not seek favourable treatment, not at all (and if I come off as such, it is a mistake that is solely on me). I do not expect people to rely on the fact that I have degrees and hire me immediately. I understand that it's a ""tough market"" and a ""numbers' game"". I just have to say that it feels that all the weight is put on work experience, while in truth it is perhaps an overrated characteristic.

I should not have to prove my ability to learn, adapt and apply. I should not have to prove my ability to mentally keep up with all kidns of hardship, from day one, all the way to graduation. I should not have to prove how adaptable and resilient people from academia are. I should not have to prove my ability to juggle dozens of responsibilities, all at once; nor my capacity to manage time, under a constant schedule made of deadlines. Are those not important anymore? Are those not crucial elements, honed through years of work experience?

Employers seem to care more about people using software A, rather software B and that's all it takes to get your application rejected. And here I am, thinking that they'd care about problem-solving (the big picture).

IMHO, I should not get rejected because I do not have 3 years of experience for a junior data analyst position (true story).

To finish up, I was lucky, finding a job, even after 1 year of search. Excuse the emotional take; I am genuinely curious to see if more people see my point of view.

Cheers.

**EDIT**: Wow! I never expected to have 100 comments to read/reply to. Hence, I feel obliged to provide a few clarification points:

* I did my PhD, not in order to improve my CV, or land my DS dream job.  I did my PhD because I wanted to explore my craft, as much as I could.
* I read quite a few valuable comments, and, to the people that took time to write them, thanks!
* I want to say that, sincerely, I do not think that my PhD alone makes me better than other candidates. I even highlighted that take in my post. Naturally, I do feel I need to prove my worth, I know that. It is something that traditionally comes after 1-2 interviews, maybe in the form of a take-home task, or live coding session. What is the main point of my rant, is that my ""success rate"", defining ""success"" as ""invited for an interview"" is \~1%, which, to me, is absurd.
* Kudos to u/dfphd for expressing myself better than I did:  ""*why is it that hiring managers assume that someone with regular work experience has these attributes, while not giving someone in academia the same credit?*"" is the main question I have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15h58oo/job_offer_mini_rant/,Drahmaputras,43,Career,132,Top - year

How does model monitoring work in a proper tech company?,1alwf27,"I might join a proper tech company soon. They’re big on monitoring models and engineering as well

Other than tracking distributional shifts in the features, how does model monitoring work for classifiers and regressors? 

I ask because in order to know a model is performing worse, you need new labels right? Like how would I know the precision or AUC ROC or AUC PR or RMSE is declining for a model in production unless new labels are in the pipeline and the model runs inference on newly labeled data?

Is it generally the case that models are built in areas where you can in fact get some sort of automated and periodically new set of labels?

When I interned at big tech, we labeled a certain search query as type A because the user clicked through and clicked a button that is a strong signal for type A actions. Basically we had a decent signal to label some queries in a somewhat automated way. Not all queries that were Type A were followed through with that button click though. Which is why I guess we built a model to try to generalize queries into Type A or not, even when no button clicking followed — we just had a set of queries where we were confident represented the positive class and marked everything else as not Type A

Data Science academic papers?,162z0cn,"Hello all. 

I recently made a career switch into data science, coming from an engineering background. I find myself proficient in the programming aspects thanks to my previous experience. However, I've noticed that I still have some ground to cover in terms of the theoretical aspects, especially in comparison to my awesome colleagues.

I've gone through several books, but they often either oversimplify concepts or get lost in mathematical demonstrations that I'm not interested in. I discussed this with my boss, and he recommended reading academic papers on data science and machine learning as a potential solution.

Coincidentally, I came across an article ([**https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-become-very-good-at-machine-learning-a78e3d93fe96**](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-become-very-good-at-machine-learning-a78e3d93fe96)) that suggests the same approach and it strongly resonates with me, so I've decided to give it a try.

To begin this new ""project"", I want to select 5 or 6 data science and machine learning papers that are relevant to daily tasks in the field. These papers don't necessarily have to be the most recent ones; my goal is for them to offer valuable insights and practical knowledge to help me in my tasks but also as an exercise for me to slowly getting used to this kind of academic writing.

Research or software development,1b84uff,"Dear hive mind, I'm in the fortunate position to have offers for two positions. They pay both basically the same however
1. Position 1 is in a large, multinational company which is currently modernizing it's product portfolio and invests heavily in research and development, where I would work on ML models for all sorts of products. I would be required to be at the office about 50% of the time and attendance is tracked using some app. The tech stack is somewhat out of date but modernizing it would be part of my tasks. Here I could learn a lot about several different domains of machine learning and data science. 
2. Position 2 is at a former startup which was recently bought by a larger company. I would have 100% wfh and a very modern tech stack, however my work would focus strongly on a very narrow range of models which are interesting to one single industry. However, this company is basically a software company so that I could learn a lot about software development and ML engineering. 

So what position would you take? I tend towards position 1 because I liked doing research at university (did my PhD in math) but position 2 seems to have better benefits and engineering is interesting as well? Also I think the skills I learn at position 1 are more valuable when switching jobs again, but I'm not sure about that. 

What would be the key factors you are looking for when considering a new position?

Should I attempt to do machine learning project without business need,1atk61o,"   
I have an incompetent data science manager and an organization that is very low on data science expertise. They have hired many data scientists and promoted numerous database engineers and analysts to data science roles. Management only wants to hear about how machine learning can save money and refuses to consider the challenges involved. We have a fraud and counterfeit problem. The directive we receive is, ""Hey, data scientists and AI experts, we know machine learning can be used for fraud detection, so save us X millions of dollars using machine learning."" However, when we investigate closely, we find many discrepancies. The only commonality between the types of fraud in our organization and the types of fraud where machine learning is successfully used is the word ""fraud."" The manager either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand. This has been happening for close to three years (even before I joined the company). It's a large organization with data scattered everywhere and many quality issues. We also don't receive many requirements from the business. I'm used to receiving a business requirement and then working with the business to determine if there's a machine learning use case, and then proceeding from there, justifying each step. However, the manager wants us to randomly come up with a use case and then go and talk to stakeholders. Does that ever work in a large organization? Most of the time, we don't even get a reply from them because they are too busy. It's even difficult to determine what is worth working on without involving the business from the beginning. The business is going to be the ultimate entity that implements our solution, so how can we do it without getting buy-in upfront? Do you have any experience navigating this kind of situation? For context, the size of the org is 100,000+ employees.

Feeling very overwhelmed with GenAI; Any suggestions for non-GenAI topics to cover in my free time?,1asdlbb,"The title says it all.

I'm so freaking tired of LLMs, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Copilot, ChatGPT, LLAMA etc etc. While I love using ChatGPT and studying what goes on inside the transformer architecture, diffusion models etc, I don't want them lurking around me 24x7. I don't want to be an LLM developer, I wanna be a data scientist who builds models to make data driven decisions. That's it!!

I am working on an LLM application in my job but in my freetime,  I'd like to study an ML topic that has nothing to do with generative AI. I'm kinda done with classical ML methods and time series analysis (for now. I will get back to them once I have a solid use case for tabular data). I want to explore something entirely new and broaden my perspective on data analysis. Survival analysis is one topic I have thought of looking into. But I'm open to suggestions. :)

When I was hired as a JDS, most of my colleagues were data analysts and my responsibilities were mostly similar to theirs (basically SQL and BI), I think I did an okay job and managed to get a promotion to regular DS. Things changed, and I was moved to a team of experienced DSs. There I will be expected to do much less data analysis and more development. Now I noticed the big skill gap and how undeserving I was of my promotion. I am extremely intimidated by my colleagues' large knowledge of our codebase (and of theory in general), and by their awareness of recent relevant papers. I also suck at networking and have a very poor knowledge of who knows/does what in the company, which everyone else seems to do well. I also don't have great presentation skills, mostly due to my lack of knowledge and subsequent insecurity. 

I know that I need to catch up, but I don't really understand how. I try to pay a lot of attention to everything that is written or said in meetings, but that almost never makes sense to me as I don't have the context. I also can never add to any meeting unless we are discussing something very close to what I have worked on. At this point, I feel super ashamed as I need to take care of one specific model that I know almost anything about. Its performance is bad and I can't figure out how to start. I am supposed at least to diagnose the model's failures but I have way too little knowledge to even figure out what to do. I could follow someone's instructions well if I had them. But as a DS I should be able to do that by myself. I know very well that working with smarter people is great for my career and that I shouldn't listen to my inner voice that tells me I should have stayed a DA. Still, I feel that I don't have the behavioral skills to take advantage of that the best way as I am introverted and have ADHD.   


I identified that my lack of attention is an issue and I am making a conscious effort to pay more attention.

In short, it describes a Python package that generates a detailed report about the data, including missing values, distribution of data, correlations, data quality alerts, etc. I've seen a few others in the same scope...

I work specifically in data quality (research) so I've been following the project for a while, but I'm curious whether you really make a case of exploring your data characteristics beforehand and how serious you consider these alerts? 

Is the DS community deep into the topic of data characteristics/complexity?

Thoughts on negotiating title change to data scientist?,15a4ppr,"I'd like to solicit some advice on asking for a title change from data analyst to data scientist. 

For background, I have about 4 years out of undergrad, with three of those being directly in an analyst or BI developer position. I did a lot of bouncing around admittedly, dealing with some of my own issues with imposter syndrome and figuring out what I really enjoy doing. 

However, I've been at my current company for a year I'm very happy with what I'm doing. I get to do predictive modeling, more in-depth stats work than I've done in the past, and basically everything I do is in Python or SQL. Because of this, combined with wanting to continue down this path and to not get stuck in BI again down the line, I think I might be able to make the case that what I'm doing is more ""data science"" work rather than ""data analyst"" work. I'm also about halfway to my MS in data science.

Considering all this, I hit my 1-year mark in a month or two and I'm thinking about asking for this title change. Does that seem reasonable? I don't want to sound like I'm just asking for it to go off and try to land a role somewhere else. I want to stay where I am, I just feel that I'm at the point in my career where I want the change reflected in my title.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15a4ppr/thoughts_on_negotiating_title_change_to_data/,CreepiosRevenge,40,Career,51,Top - year
Why do we use multiple neurons in hidden layer for a simple ANN?,158ef4u,"When we have such a simple neural network, where we have all neurons of the hidden layer, receiving exactly the same input and the same number of inputs (nth features), from the previous layer. Will it be right to say that the only reason of using multiple neurons in the hidden layer is to initialize random weights and/or biases to all neurons, just so we avoid getting trapped into some local minima? Or are there other reasons of using multiple neurons?  I do understand that there could be several reasons to use multiple neurons, but my question is specifically for the neural network shown in image above.

Prospects for a (very computational) STEM PhD in FAANG?,1avmzz6,"Hey folks, 

&#x200B;

Last spring I completed a PhD in computational astrophysics - I don't want to go into too much detail as my field is small, but my thesis subject was a monte carlo simulation that I wrote which generated and analyzed many PB of data (yes, I realize that sounds ridiculous - it was ridiculous and it required several supercomputers and a few millions of core hours). The sim was in c++ and most mathematical analysis was written from scratch in c/c++. I'm now about a year into a postdoc which is focused on subject matter very closely related to my thesis work, and also dealing with very large and complex data sets. 

&#x200B;

I have come to realize recently that I'm satisfied with my contributions to science, and I am unsatisfied with how financially far behind I am relative to most people my age (lot of student debt, no retirement, no racecar, etc.).  I'm ready to move on. In addition to my very unique computational and data management/analysis experience, I have some light ML experience and worked for a few years as a SWE for a DoD contractor (prior to grad school). I do not have SQL experience, and my python game is meh but getting better.

&#x200B;

I know FAANG is notoriously hard to break into - anyone here made the transition from hardcore computational STEM to FAANG DS, or any other very high paying DS role? Is it realistic to pursue research based ML roles with only minor past ML experience given my rather unique skills/experience? Any advice on making the transition or skills I should be adding to my resume before I start spamming applications in the coming months?

Anyone gone back for a PhD in statistics after being in industry? [Q],15jqlaa,"Was networking these past few weeks at a company career panel for the place I was interning at this summer. Two people had similar backgrounds to me (BS statistics). They ended up talking about how they progressed at the company starting out, the overall tasks they had, and what they were doing now as they have progressed. Both graduated school in 2015.

Both of them talked about their entry level data science job, as follows:

“Panelist 2 and I were both hired here at the consulting firm, and at the time another consultant was starting a “AI Transformative Technologies lab” that was just in its infancy. As fresh graduates, with out backgrounds we got by far our dream job. Panelist 2 and I were basically, from 8-5 everyday, were printing out stacks of deep learning papers, and building industry specific case studies for deep learning. In consulting, you often have many different clients for different industries, so we spent just everyday, building out a portfolio of case studies where we applied SOTA deep learning models, and pitched them to clients in each industry. Overall a dream job where we combined deep learning research with client facing presentations”.

All in all, sounded like a dream job to me. Both of them worked 9 years, doing this, and then when I talked to them after, they both mentioned how they were now heading back to academia to do a PhD in statistics and the other a PhD in CS. At 31 years old, they are leaving this job, because they had moved up to a management level, and wanted to get back into deep learning again, and felt that academia and doing a PhD was where they felt they could succeed. 

I tell this story because sometimes I’ve thought about this. I have an MS, but I know after a few years I’m gonna miss the theoretical stuff I did in my MS, and will probably considering doing a PhD just for that. But something about that doesn’t seem right. It feels that my motivation to go back to do a PhD is to “learn more advanced stats” so I can get away from managerial positions. Cause truthfully, I just don’t really care about managing people, owning a product, or any of the corporate political BS that comes with moving up in a company. 

Has anyone else done a similar route to what those two panelists did? How has it been for you? What was that transition like? Do you regret it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15jqlaa/anyone_gone_back_for_a_phd_in_statistics_after/,Direct-Touch469,38,Discussion,82,Top - year
Rant - I feel like the nature of DS work is becoming less and less creative.,151r5sx,"Some backgroud - I've been working for ~15 years in various modeling related roles (statistical programmer/research scientist/xyz analyst/DS). Lately I feel increasingly disheartened about the type of work I'm asked to do, as well as the quality of work in data science generally. 

When I first started, to build a good model, whether predictive or inferential, I'd do research into the domain, come up with my own mental models and hypotheses of what actually shapes the behavior of your dependent variable, then knit together different quantitative methods to formalize the knowledge into a testable model. I had a lot of freedom over the ""backend"", and could build a custom tech stack and data pipeline tailored for the specific needs of the project.

Nowadays, with the dominance of GBDT and DL for predictive modeling, nothing really matters except scale, resources, and computing power. Optimization and compatability are all important so everyone ends up using the same models, the same tech, the same ""mlops"" frameworks. My previous job was working on an ASR model for a voice assistant at a big tech, which sounds cool to a lot of people, but in reality the actual work consisted of editing config files and making minor optimizations to different parameters. The only work that ever required brainpower was engineering work, not modeling work. I work at a much smaller company now but still, everything is about prebuilt tools and prebuilt models and prebuilt architectures.

Inferential analytics can still be fun, but it's increasingly rare with more business activity shifting online and thus A/B tests increasingly common. Plus, the quality/time bar on these projects keeps dropping - frankly because many new DS hires have limited knowledge/care about anything that's not ML, and will churn out very low quality output for analytics work. And increasingly I see people pumping out fishy analytics models just to get results that align with management/executive expectations. 

Anyone feel similarly? Or am I just having an ""old many yells at cloud"" moment?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/151r5sx/rant_i_feel_like_the_nature_of_ds_work_is/,puppy_nap,38,Discussion,25,Top - year
"For deep learning practitioners in industry, is the workflow always this annoying? [Q]",14vjwlj,"Right now I’m working on a multivariate time series classification problem for a lab I’m working at. The training set is a multivariate time series with data collected over minutely level. Each time series is a type of positional tracking measurement. The goal is to classify each of the time series and see if they can discriminate between 3 different types of outcomes of interest. The labels are 0,1,2.

I’m doing this in PyTorch, and I read roughly 8-9 papers. They all seem to point to convolutional neural networks as a starting point. After building the model and setting up the training loops, this whole process feels like maybe 1% model building and 99% debugging, tuning, architecture changing, and tensor shape checking.

My day to day has just been stepping through my architecture with a debugger to fix bugs I’m getting during training, such as tensor mismatches, floating point error, and tuning of hyper parameters to mitigate the low test errors. 

Don’t even get me started on the runtime. I tweak one or two parameters, wait like 10 minutes, then check the results. Rinse and repeat. Now I’ve realized that my data representation is probably not correct and have to redo everything. Half the time is spent getting the data to be appropriately be shaped correctly so the network is doing stuff correctly. 

I thought I’d want a career in building deep learning models in the industry, but honestly, idk at this point after this project. It feels less of model building and more of model debugging. Half the stuff I’m doing feels arbitrary. Tweak a kernel size to this, make the number filters to that. See what happens and pray the accuracy is higher.

I actually felt more aware of what I was doing with data when I was previously doing work on Bayesian hierarchical models in Stan. Made so much sense. You write out the model, specify the prior and likelihoods, make any transformations if you need be, and then draw samples from posterior. Making distributional assumptions just made me feel like I knew what I was doing. 

With this deep learning project, it feels like 60% I know what’s going on because of the papers, 30% I can do because of domain knowledge of the dataset, and 10% I have no clue what’s going on and how parameters are affecting the model. I just tweaked the number of filters from 10, 12, and voila! A boost in accuracy by 10%. But no explanation for why.

[Q] - What is the best way to find the direction and contribution of each feature when doing a regression using Random Forest?,14eedsl,"I work as a beginner data scientist in a startup where I don't have any expert in the field to rely on.  


At the moment, I am working on project for a big customer and they are asking how each of their operational metrics affect one important metric, let's call it ""y"".  


They would like to get the individual contribution of each feature  in terms of % increase or decrease of ""y"". For instance, the best way would be to have a linear regression where each coefficient has a weight with it's corresponding variation YoY and when you multiply them together and sum the percentage contribution you get the variation of ""y"" YoY.  


I have tried so many things:  
\- tried linear regression (fitted many models and chose the best using the R squared adjusted, but the model was predicting an increase of ""y"" instead of a decrease)  
\- tried to fit Random Forest and SVR then tried to use SHAP and LIME to interpret the predictions. LIME is not stable and doesn't give a coherent story, while SHAP doesn't give a convincing story. For instance, it says that one of the variable positively affects ""y"" while physically it doesn't make sense.

We provide relevant details of data schema as input and expect the LLM to generate a response written in our custom domain-specific language, which we then convert into a UI exploration.

We've shared more details in a blog post: https://www.supersimple.io/blog/gpt-4-fine-tuning-early-access

I'm curious if anyone has explored similar approaches in other domains or perhaps used entirely different techniques within a similar context.

Can you get reprimanded for logging your hours for your job for working extra?,1b2lw0z,"Got a mouthful from my manager about me working extra and that i didnt communicate that i have to work extra. Despite actually communicating this and sending the work at like 7-8 PM. 

For example: i get ask at 3-4 pm and they want numbers next day. So i started logging my hours as my teammates and I have to work extra just to meet the deadlines, maintain the existing jobs, and also do asks.

What i got was that in my team we never had people log their hours despite the fact that everyone is overworked to the bone and my coworker literally said she wants to quit and hates it.

so as a community how should i proceed as my manager wants to escalate and I dont understand what i did wrong. I literally logged the hours that i worked after communicating that i have to work extra. Am

how do I politely ask the head of the department to cancel the daily meetings routine?,1av80sc,"First, I am adding the great thread from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/y3ty7k/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_daily_standup/) about daily meetings for DS teams.

Daily meetings are used for data scientists to briefly summarize what they did, well, in the last day. As mentioned in the first thread, it should not be longer than 90 sec per person, in some of the companies it is called stand-up meeting and it is done literally while standing in order to make it quick.

However, I still have a few problems with it. Some context - I am a team lead in a mainly remote position.

Our head of the department treats it as a place to mingle and get updated with everyone, that is, a mixture between a professional meeting and a social event. It usually makes this meeting being 25-30 minutes.

It seems that the team members join only because they must. They don't participate in a conversation, they don't exchange ideas, and basically just wait for the meeting to end. My head of the department, on the other side, is a big talker, and usually at the end of the daily starts with a five-seven minutes monologue about what he is going to do, what he did, and usually it is the same stuff that he already went over yesterday.

Moreover, and sorry in advance for my French, it is the first meeting in the morning, so after one has their coffee and would prefer a silent morning/a meeting with the toilet, we have to nod for 30 minutes.

Lastly, and most importantly, things in DS are moving slowly. Not everyday we have things to update about. I have meetings with my team members every two days, which are profound, we brainstorm and derive tasks. This is the place where I track their progress and give them feedback. I don't need to see them every day (unless they need me).

&#x200B;

I would like to ask my manager (head of) to make the daily meetings actually twice/three times a week, and instead, I will brief him myself, on 1on1, even on a daily for just the management.

Anyone here quit their job in DS to travel for an extended time (3-12 months)... then managed to land a job when you're back?,16l4pha,"I am planning to quit my job as a Data Science consultant (more Data Analytics tbh) soon. Since I was in secondary school, I have been wanting to take a gap year. During uni breaks/summer holidays, I''ve always done some kind of internship or work shadowing  before eventually working full time right after uni (I was lucky to find a job within one month of graduating). I've never really took a long break.

At the moment, I'm likely to go with 6 months of travelling rather than a year as I'm afraid of being out of a job for too long and it ruining my career prospects. I'm fortunate enough to have money to sustain myself for a year without pay though, including any emergencies.

My biggest worry is being able to land a job when I'm back.. I have been wanting to leave consulting for a while now, so my goal is to secure a data role that is 'good enough' in an industry. For the past few months, I've been passively applying for jobs and going for interviews, but I feel that the market is definitely still bad. Not sure if this helps, but I'm based in London. I was a Data Analyst (corporate firm) for a year, then currently a Data Analytics consultant for almost 3 years.

Will Data Science stop being a plan-B for generalist PhD holders?,162h8yh,"With the advent of more and more dedicated advanced Data Science degrees, will PhD holders in ""general"" (non DS/ML/CS) areas stop being hired as DSs in the next few years?

Given the list of requirements I've seen on job listings, it appears that the times in which PhDs were hired due to their skills to learn and think analytically outside the box (if this ever was really a thing), are far in the past. It looks to me that, currently, even for entry-level jobs, the market favors people with the full stack of specific technical skills plus experience already under their arms. Put another way, freshly graduated PhDs are just not adecquate for entry-level jobs.

Apologies if the question isn't very well formulated. For context, I've noticed that some friends who recently finished their PhD (say math or physics) and are currently looking for DS roles, are pretty much being ignored by recruiters. What I'd like to understand is if this responds to global factors where everyone is being treated ""equally"" in difficult times, or if having a generalist PhD by itself is never gonna cut it again (if ever). Could online courses (not an online DS master!) still be relevant for these PhDs to get a job, or would PhD holders have to go back to school and do a DS master's should they decide to pursue this career for a lack of a better option?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/162h8yh/will_data_science_stop_being_a_planb_for/,SincopaDisonante,37,Career,60,Top - year

At what point do you consider dropping a categorical feature with missing values?,13rqsuz,"Hey all, I'm a month into my first true DS role and have run into something I'm not super experienced with. I know there's no hard and fast rule here, but I'd be curious to hear some discussion.

I have a dataset with a categorical variable that has na's for about 20% of its values. While there are many other features (about 20), I think that this would be a pretty useful feature to include in the model (just going off of domain knowledge here). There are three categories for this feature, with the most common category occurring about 60% of the time. As far as I'm aware, my main options are to:

1. Drop the feature altogether
2. Drop the rows where the feature is missing (losing about 20% of my dataset)
3. Replace the na's with the most commonly occurring category

To be honest, I'm not thrilled with any of these options. Any thoughts on which approach may be the best route here? Is there something else that I'm missing? Would appreciate any advice.

Who owns your notes? Where do you keep them?,135k3tv,"I work in data science and I am also do some non-work personal coding projects and education.

As a result I have extensive notes and code snippets on many topics that also overlap:  bash, python, sql etc.  I refer to these notes every day and they make me more effective.

I have an underlying concern, however, about accessing these references.

How do you guys document your models?,1b7mrdm,"I work at a company that does quantitative pricing for sporting events. We have a variety of models, but there is no documentation. To understand how a model works, you need to read through the code. Now, I'm in favour of writing good code such that someone CAN read through it to understand what is going on. However, I believe there are certain benefits to having a document that outlines the approach, compares it with others etc. While we produce a semi-technical project report to disseminate to stakeholders, I'd like to also document the deep technical dive.  


My team is familiar with LaTeX, and I am currently thinking about including Overleaf in our workflows to encourage some rigour and proper documentation. However, if a slight change is urgently made to the model's code, should that be reflected in the LaTeX document? How should the document be versioned?

The nutshell: tech jobs are scraped from Indeed, a transformer-based pipeline extracts skills and classifies the jobs, and Power BI presents the visualizations. 

Notable changes from the report I shared a few months back are:

* Skills have a custom fuzzy match to resolve their canonical form
* Years of experience is pulled from each span the skill is found within the posting and calculated
* Pay is extracted and calculated for multiple frequencies (annual, monthly, weekly, etc.)
* Job titles and skills are embedded using the latest OpenAI model (Large) and then clustered
* Skill count and pay percentile (what are the top skills for the job and which skills pay the most)
   * Ordered by highest to lowest in the table
* Apple is hiring a shit ton of AI/ML (translation: the singularity is *nearer*)

The full report is available at my website [hazon.fyi](https://hazon.fyi)

Some things I want to do next:

* NER: Education and certifications
   * Easy to do but boring
* Subcategories: Add subcats to large categories (i.e. Software Engineering > DevOps)
* Assistant API: Build a resume builder that leverages the OpenAI Assistant API
* Observable Framework: Build some decent visuals now that I have a website

Please let me know what you think, critique first.

Advice for a New Data Scientist Struggling with Criticism,1an0kee,"As a relatively new data scientist, I need some frank advice. 

I recently switched from a more traditional software engineer role to a more data focused role. I'd describe myself as an exceptional data engineer, and an average, but enthusiastically improving data scientist. To that end, I'm also in school working through a graduate program in data science (50% done). 

My issue is that the better I get (at least on paper), the more people seem to criticize my analysis. There's many analysts at my office, but very few legitimate data science positions and I've had more than one good friend tell me that my analysis was too hard to understand. This always hits hard because I work very hard to be fair, honest, and understandable.

I honestly don't know if I'm being needlessly complex (to show off), if I'm bad at explaining my analysis, or if I'm just talking in the wrong way to the wrong people. I will say that it absolutely could be an ego issue because I do often feel a strong need to differentiate myself from the growing BI community. 

Is this a common feeling/experience for new data scientists?  For those of you that are more experienced, when you are asked to analyze data for general consumption (for non engineers), do you dumb everything down and leave out the checks and validation that give you confidence in your answers? 

If you are curious, this is probably a [decently representative project that I did for school](https://default.qc0qma7a4qq1g.us-east-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/results).

Thoughts on The Book “Essential Math For Data Science”?,133bpns,"Haven’t seen much discussion of it here. I am mentoring an aspiring DS. She hadn’t taken a math course in about 10 years. She read this book over the course of about a month, and after looking over it, I thought it was pretty good. It was a no fluff introduction to the algebra, calculus, linear algebra, statistics needed for basic DS. 

Now of course this book wouldn’t make you a researcher, but it seemed like enough to be dangerous on the job as a product or analytics focused DS, before diving into math more deeply.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/133bpns/thoughts_on_the_book_essential_math_for_data/,None,37,Discussion,5,Top - year
I've found myself in a very unique situation at work. Has anyone else been here?,12k6j9x,"So, I work for a very large company in their finance department. I recently got a new role on the data analytics team, and to my surprise, it seems like no one knows anything about data science, analytical methods, or best practices. 

A bit about myself, for the past 2 years, I've been teaching myself data science in order to get ahead. In this time, I've become really fluent in python, SQL, VBA, and general concepts such as ETL, wrangling...etc. I've also been able to use a lot of what I've learned in my current role. I'm by no means an expert, but I've been able to make some good progress at work with what I've done so far.

Back to the new role. I had a couple of interviews with my new boss and director, and started describing the ETL process I do for email data. They had never heard of ETL. Beyond that, someone from their team reached out to me later and asked if I could help them find the name for a database in MS SQL. When I asked what type of data they were looking for they sent me a screenshot of the table with db name attached. It seemed as if they didn't understand the difference between a db, server, or table.

I'm excited for the opportunity, but has anyone else been here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/12k6j9x/ive_found_myself_in_a_very_unique_situation_at/,kkessler1023,35,Career,20,Top - year
Pay rate for data science contractor,12foi3l,"I am getting paid $22/hr to do data science as a contractor. I work at a small start-up based in San Francisco. I am about to graduate with a bachelor's degree in May, and I have a few years of data science experience (at other places).

I recently asked for a pay raise, because I know that $22/hr isn't enough, especially once I have a degree. They agreed to pay me more, but I'm not sure how much exactly to ask for. How much should someone with my level of education/experience be getting paid to do data science contract work?

Struggling to mentor junior,1afm33o,"As a senior engineer, I'm leading a machine learning project for a client in commodity trading. Our current stage involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the client's data, create valuable features, and generate insights.

During the EDA, I'm focusing on regression analysis for feature importance. Meanwhile, I've assigned a junior engineer to cluster the data based on feature characteristics. However, mentoring him is challenging due to his reluctance to explore unfamiliar concepts. For instance, he's hesitant to include metrics like stock price elasticity of demand in his analysis, despite its significance to the client and my explanation of its importance.

His analytical inexperience seems overwhelming for him, leading to a dismissive attitude towards more complex concepts. How can I effectively guide him to be more open and proactive in his approach to the analysis?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for suggestions. I think I just needed to make it explicitly clear to him that it is okay for him to take time to learn the theory behind clustering and give him time to think.  I think this was causing the issue because we had a bullshit deadline by the end of the week (including his analysis) to get this done, but I successfully pushed it back so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1afm33o/struggling_to_mentor_junior/,caksters,34,Discussion,18,Top - year

Caching Jupyter Notebook Cells for Faster Reruns,18lh3f4,"Hey r/datascience! We created a plugin to easily cache the results of functions in jupyter notebook cells. The intermediate results are stored in a pickle file in the same folder.

This helps solve a few common pains we've experienced:

\- **accidentally overwriting variables**: You can re-run a given cell and re-populate any variable (e.g. if you reassigned \`df\` to some other value)\_

\- **sharing notebooks for others to rerun / reproduce**: Many collaborators don't have access to all the same clients / tokens, or all the datasets. Using xetcache, notebook authors can cache any cells / functions that they know are painful for others to reproduce / recreate.

\- **speed up rerunning**: even in single player mode, being able to rerun through your entire notebooks in seconds instead of minutes or hours is really really fun

Efficient alternatives to a cumbersome VBA macro,18jy1dy,"I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the most appropriate subreddit, but I got to thinking about a project at work.

My job role is somewhere between data analyst and software engineer for a big aerospace manufacturing company, but digital processes here are a bit antiquated. A manager proposed a project to me in which financial calculations and forecasts are done in an Excel sheet using a VBA macro - and when I say huge I mean this thing is 180mb of aggregated financial data. To produce forecasts for monthly data someone quite literally runs this macro and leaves their laptop on for 12 hours overnight to run it.

I say this company's processes are antiquated because we have no ML processes, Azure, AWS or any Python or R libraries - just a base 3.11 installation of Python is all I have available.

I’ve noticed that when I try to read up on data science interviews, I’m disproportionately very weak in everything related to probability.

For example, I struggle with most of the “easy” problems in the probability chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview.

DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs. Here's the summary of how it's going after the seventh month,15mn7om,"Hi all,

on Dec 19th I launched [DataAnalyst.com](https://dataanalyst.com) \- this is the seventh update of hopefully many more to come - it'll be a shorter one this time.

 Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on. 

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/datascience might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

## Stats

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 7 months and we've brought over 1,500 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range. 

There's almost 1,600 people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

Following the site traffic and visitors peak in April/May, there's been a noticeable drop on those metrics.

In the early days, I would be posting between 10 - 15 jobs daily, looking to brute-force the marketplace conundrum and bring initial traffic in. At the same time I knew this was not sustainable in the long run, particularly on the monetization front - if companies see jobs added by me for free, why would they engage themselves?

So for now, I'm attributing this dump in traffci to the decrease in number of job postings added daily to the site and potentially also the wide-spread summer slump - people taking time off, organizations are slowing down hiring (which I've also noticed when hand picking available roles) and overall, activity drops.

The decrease also goes hand in hand with decrease of social media posts on Twitter/Linked, leading to less social media traffic. I have however added new profile pages on Facebook and Instagram, similarly automating job postings there, so will see how those channels perform.

While looking at the numbers go down isn't a pretty sight, I do believe that in combination with the organic traffic, it makes sense to have the (hopefully) short term dip, as it'll pave way for monetizing. Obviously this means there will be less jobs to apply to for now, but until I see steady inflow of company-posted jobs, I will not be looking to decrease the frequency / quality / quanity of listings any more.

I've also spent some time last month using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site. This is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier, but oh well.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

Some of you may have noticed that I've also recently launched [BusinessAnalyst.com](https://bussinessanalyst.com) \- where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 6 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Seeing July has been the first full month of having the site up, I will be also documenting the journey and posting a progress update on appropriate subreddits.

# 2. Expanding the data analyst salary guide

We are continuing on our mission to building out DataAnalyst.com - not just as a job board, but also as an educational hub - from interviews with experienced professional, best practices, to advice about getting into the industry.

As mentioned in my previous updates, there's been guides recently released.

**How to become a data analyst guide** which covers topics such as:

* understanding the role and responsibilities of a data analyst
* becoming a data analyst, and what it obtains - from education, experience, to technical and soft skills
* the well known not-so-secret hack - building your own portfolio
* career development and salary guide (yes, our own!)

[**The data analyst salary guide**](https://www.dataanalyst.com/salary-guide) \- which provides the overview of salaries in various industries - and also shows a more detailed view on each industry page, with a deep dive into how much entry level, senior and lead data analysts can earn depending on their experience. 

Over the course of last month I've been restructuring some of the ways I collect and store data about available job roles, and I was able to expand the data analyst salary guide beyond just industry - now also detailing **data analyst salaries across different states in the US.**

Now, as it usually is with this kind of exercise, lumping the data all together you come up with an insane range. On the other hand, if you split the data in 52 different ways, you'll get a whole different set of issues where N is not large enough to draw any conclusions - and for some states, there's simply no data at all.

As the site grows, and the number of jobs on the site increases, I do however believe that I'll be able to bring an addition source of information about salaries, complimenting those already available on other sites.

For the US, we've also released the July edition of Market Insights, you can see the full report in the blog section on the site as well.

# What's currently on my mind (random musings)

**Re: Newsletter** \- when starting, I wanted the newsletter to be sent on a weekly basis, containing the latest jobs. The more I thought about it, the more I became against the idea - afterall, people could visit the site and see, why spam their emails? At the same time, the point of the site is to help people find a role - once they would, they wouldn't really need weekly emails with latest jobs.

I was recently able to implement better tracking of job views - how many people have viewed which job post. It may be that I could use this data to send a weekly ""hottest data analyst jobs on the plafrom for the last week"" - however, to do so, I believe I need to include segmentation into my email list i.e people looking for a job will receive these, whilst others would be able to opt out. This will require some restructuring of the current newsletter onboarding flow, but that's probably better to be done sooner, rather than later.

**Re: Improving site experience** \- I go through every single comment I receive on Reddit, and there's been a few in the last month or two, highlighting some inconsistencies in terms of UX/UI experience across mobile/table/desktop versions. I've spent some time over the last few weeks to address some of those bugs, discovered a whole bunch more, and have been fixing them one by one. I do want the site to be easy to use, with consistent styling and experience - so, if you come across bugs, please just let me know :)

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know...., but...above...)
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

# 3 ways you could help

Is a Convex Optimization class good for Data Science?,17gc0b4," For context, I am a Master's student in CS and lurking in sub has made me realize that CS guys need more statistical background regarding DS positions. Hence, the motivation. However, I am already taking a course called Foundations course which feels like a quick Statistics walkthrough. I am also taking an Automated Learning course which basically follows the ISL contents. This course would be the third one? or the fourth one if I plan to audit this one.

This is what the course page says : 

Student Learning Outcomes: 

Master the essential tools of convex analysis, ability to characterize solutions to convex optimization problems, ability to formulate standard data science problems as convex optimization problems, and understanding the structure and implementation of the main classes of algorithms for solving optimization problems in data science.

Detailed Content: 

Iteration principles, fixed-point algorithms, convex sets and convex cones, best approximation paradigms, projection methods in convex feasibility problems – applications to data fusion and image recovery, convex functions, conjugation of convex functions, duality in convex optimization, subdifferential calculus, subgradient algorithms for convex feasibility and best approximation – applications in inverse problems, proximity operators, proximal calculus, forward-backward splitting and variants (Dykstra-like methods, Chambolle-Pock algorithm, dual ascent method, etc.), Douglas-Rachford splitting and variants (parallel proximal algorithm, alternating direction method of multipliers, composite primal-dual method, etc.), the monotone + skew decomposition principle – primal-dual algorithms, proximal modeling of statistical information, proximal information extraction, proximal sparsity enforcement, proximal data classification, proximal principal component analysis, proximal image reconstruction, proximal learning, proximal methods for matrix-based learning, scalability: proximal methods in big data problems, special topics.

I've managed to automate a PDF report that has some basic stuff using Plotly and Pandas and am wondering where I should focus my efforts next.

What are the general low hanging fruits that I should try and start out with for a business that has very little maturity on this front?

Chat GPT has come back with some suggestions like: Customer segmentation, Churn analysis, sales forecasting, website optimisation, recommendation engines, predictive CLV.  

Any help or insights would be appreciated pointing me in the right direction.  Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/130hqft/low_hanging_fruit_projects_for_business_with/,BobzzYourUncle,34,Discussion,23,Top - year

Communicating timeline when you don't know anything,1bj06rk,"So I'm writing this on behalf of a poor colleague, and also myself at times.

Situation: My colleague is being made to deploy something from scratch (container, infra, etc.) when this used to be done by the MLOps team. I told him that it's doable with some engineering help on the infra side, and he doesn't disagree, but he has no clue how he's supposed to communicate timelines back to the business when he has never done this before (not knowing what he doesn't know.) And neither do I.

How to prepare myself for next role as NLP Engineer/DS?,1axqwyj,"My current position is Senior Data Scientist, it is my second role, before that I was a DS consultant and I have about 4-5 yoe, depends on you count it. 

I have been working at my current place for about 2 years, and I got to the point where my learning is bounded. I am very appreciated at my current workplace, and I had the luck of entering to the company at a good time, so I took part in the development of several central pipelines, and saw our product become profitable. For the past six months, however, I have been feeling stuck and frustrated. Due to bad management we are now micro-managed by our CEO. It doesn't look like I have a lot of place to grow, and my direct manager isn't at a point he can guild me on ML and has a very modest technical stack to be generous. 

For the past year, I started to develop interest in NLP, and since then I did on my spare time a lot of learning and some side project in varying complexity. In my work as well, I was able to push for using some of the things that I learned (also by doing extra hours, but it was for me as well). So far I led a project were we trained a RoBERTa model from scratch, including tokenization as we deal with somewhat a different domain than the off-the-shelf pre-trained datasets are familiar with. I also trained more modest models including siamese network to learn similarity between strings of different sources, and a Word2Vec for word embeddings when the use case made more sense than using contextual embeddings. All of the above are projects that ended up being delivered to customers, which I led from a-z.

I know that in four months or so, I would like to start looking for a new place, and I know that I am looking for a place where I could deepen my knowledge about working with textual data. In the meantime I am trying to read as many papers as my time allows (both inside and outside of work), and I try to look for problems I can solve with NLP in my current workplace. Our main product is based on classification and we are heavily focus on low latency, so with these two limitations, I am struggling to see how transformer decoders (LLMs) can help. 

I don't know if the above would suffice to land a first job as an NLP engineer/DS in a company that focuses on textual data. **I am wondering what can I do in order to set myself apart from other candidates, and what hiring managers in such companies look for in a prospective candidate**.

Is there something like this for data science that’s not a research paper on the latest ML techniques, but rather case studies on how companies have used data science to solve their problems.

Should I just stick to the Harvard business review and try to curate data science case studies?

Fraud can mean a lot of things, and this is a bit different than credit card fraud, etc. My team hires third-party contractors to collect specific information in rural villages, but our compensation structure is per piece of information (non-negotiable, unfortunately) and therefore incentivizes them to fabricate the data they collect either in part or in whole.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1aes9jn/resources_for_fraud_detectionprevention/,None,31,Discussion,9,Top - year

Let's team up and create an app to detect fermentation issues in style! 🥬🧪,19bnuia,"Hi all

I spend a lot of time on /r/fermentation and I've noticed that many posts there are along the lines of ""I made this thing, is it infected?"" Most of the time, it's perfectly fine. The real dangerous stuff, like mold, is usually easy to spot. This got me thinking about creating an app that allows users to upload photos and get help in identifying obvious issues. 

my tensorflow fu is weak but my data engineer skills are strong. anyone interested in partnering up in putting this together?  what i need from you:

\- Assistance with the TensorFlow (or alternative) model. My preference is to use Python for the web layer.

\- Help in collecting input and validation data. I have come across a few smaller datasets, but I'm not sure if they are extensive enough for training and validating the model.

&#x200B;

Here's what I'll bring to the project:

\- I'll take the TensorFlow model and build a Streamlit app on top of it.

\- The app layer will have a FastAPI backend endpoint.

\- I'll cover all infrastructural or hosting costs.

\- The app will be hosted on Kubernetes (K8s) and available over SSL through Nginx.

\- Any changes committed to GitHub will be deployed through ArgoCD.

&#x200B;

Please note that this is a hobby project and it will never be a paid service. I'm not doing this to enhance my resume; I simply think it's a cool idea that can be (relatively) easily achieved.

&#x200B;

Here are the common contaminants I'd like to identify. The really harmful ones have bright colors that contrast nicely:

&#x200B;

\- Mold: Any mold growth should be considered potentially harmful.

   1. Penicillium: This mold can appear as blue or green patches on the surface of sauerkraut.

   2. Cladosporium: This mold typically appears as black or brown spots.

   3. Aspergillus: This mold can appear in various colors such as green, black, or gray.

   4. Mucor: This mold may show as white or gray fuzzy patches on the surface.

&#x200B;

\- Yeast: Yeast is not typically considered harmful, but it can lead to off flavors.

   1. Kahm yeast is a type of wild yeast . not dangerous but off tasting. It appears as a white or cream-colored film on the surface and can sometimes develop in areas where the brine is exposed to air.

I'm coming into a more standard data science role which will primarily use python and SQL. In your experience, what are your go to applications for SQL (oracleSQL) and how do you get that data into python?

This may seem like a silly question to ask as a DA/DS professional already, but professionally I have been working in a lesser used application known as alteryx desktop designer. It's a tools based approach to DA that allows you to use the SQL tool to write queries and read that data straight into the workflow you are working on. From there I would do my data preprocessing in alteryx and export it out into a CSV for python where I do my modeling. I am already proficient in stats/DS and my SQL is up to snuff, I just don’t know what other people use  and their pipeline from SQL to python since our entire org basically only uses Alteryx.

Using synthetic data to reduce a form of hallucination in LLMs,15v4oys,"**Credit: I read about this in** [**this AI newsletter**](https://tomorrownow.beehiiv.com/p/new-ai-social-media-app-befake-llms-will-agree-false-claims-four-camps-ai-doom-scenarios) **and the research paper was written by Google Deepmind.**

**Summary**:

*Researchers investigated ""sycophancy"" in LLMs - the tendency to agree with a user's opinion, even if it's wrong. Models even agreed with blatantly false math claims if the user signaled agreement. Analyzing three sycophancy tasks showed model size and instruction tuning increased this behavior. A simple synthetic data intervention was proposed, fine-tuning models to strengthen resistance to freely available opinions. This reduced sycophantic behavior, especially on new prompts.*

&#x200B;

**Why does it matter?**

* Bigger isn't always better: Larger LLMs displayed more sycophantic behavior, suggesting scale alone won't solve this issue. Instruction tuning also increased sycophancy.
* Social grounding requires care: Humans operate within shared social frames of reference. Simulating social dynamics for AI comes with risks if models lack proper grounding in facts/logic.
* More work to be done: Simple solutions like synthetic data fine-tuning are promising starting points, but comprehensively addressing problematic behaviors like sycophancy will require more sophisticated solutions.

Data Engineering as fallback once the LLM hype dies down?,15pb4rq,"I am facing quite a lot of anxiety about the DS field right now. I am a data scientist on paper, but for the past few years doing “full-stack” ML developments.

Over the recent months I saw so many organizations expanding their DS teams with the intention of integrate AI into their products, seemingly solely out of hype from the business execs or investors. Many of these AI features don’t seem to generate enough business value compared to the cost of building them. I’m sure at one point the businesses will notice this too. Obviously I know not all of DS is ML, but a huge portion of the job demands out there have that expectation.

All these could be just my anxiety speaking, so please correct me if I’m mistaken about the current situation. However, my guts is telling me to make the jump to data engineering, which is the closest thing to what currently do, but my degree was in Stats and not CS.

Data Analyst Bootcamp,15acrw9,"Hello beautiful Reddit community 

I would like to put you in a bit of context about my case and see if you can help me, I would be eternally grateful. 

Well, I'm a 28 year old chemical engineer, currently not working in the field I study (My programming skills are not the best, but I practice almost every day).

I have been working as a credit analyst for almost 3 years, but I got desperate to grow since you have to be friends with the senior manager. 

 So I have decided to create a path in the data world and become a data analyst as soon as I had the knowledge requested. 

This is something I was itching with curiosity since 1 year approx. So since then I have been self taught with Python, but of course I know this is not enough.

So I have asked for information about some bootcamps in my country, but in my opinion, these are quite expensive and not recognized enough that another bootcamp in another country might have. 

Yesterday I saw a post where a guy was asking for help for a good example of bootcamp, and someone answered that Great Learning with MIT bootcamps collaboration is a very good option. So I had my interview a few minutes ago and the prices are not that expensive and it's close to my budget. 

 So I am here entirely asking for your help and advice you could give me and if you recommend me which bootcamp or if you have another option it will be well appreciated.

I would like however, to hear some instances where you guys are leveraging causal inference  
In your day to day, and more importantly the areas of business where causality and causal inference could be a potential goal for businesses to gain more insights. 

Some ideas that come to mind is in experimentation. Can we leverage these causal inference methodologies to improve in marketing analytics? How can causality be interpreted with A/B testing? 

I’d like to know, whether it be using rubins potential outcomes framework, or pearls DAGs. 

How are you all leveraging causality and causal inference in data science?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14sjss2/leveraging_causality_in_data_science_how_are_you/,Direct-Touch469,33,Discussion,34,Top - year

"I created a four-page Data Science Cheatsheet to assist with exam reviews, interview prep, and anything in-between",ljftgi,"Hey guys, I’ve been doing a lot of preparation for interviews lately, and thought I’d compile a document of theories, algorithms, and models I found helpful during this time. Originally, I was just keeping notes in a Google Doc, but figured I could create something more permanent and aesthetic.

It covers topics (some more in-depth than others), such as:

* Distributions
* Linear and Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees and Random Forest
* SVM
* KNN
* Clustering
* Boosting
* Dimension Reduction (PCA, LDA, Factor Analysis)
* NLP
* Neural Networks
* Recommender Systems
* Reinforcement Learning
* Anomaly Detection

The four-page Data Science Cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet/blob/main/Data_Science_Cheatsheet.pdf), and I hope it's helpful to those looking to review or brush up on machine learning concepts.

I just got offered a data science internship with Amazon. I've been lurking on the sub for 3 years and just wanted to thank the folks who put together stats/ml cheat sheets.,mmzbgq,"This sub really motivated me to take my undergraduate degree in biomathematics/statistics and turn it into a masters in data science. I use to think I wouldn't have the programing background or that I wouldn't have the technical skills people wanted. It took a lot of my moving past my imposter syndrome as a woman in stem and working on my skill set but I've gotten this far. Thank you all so much.

Edit: Just came back to this post and saw all the support. For any one interested i have been applying since September to internships and have since then applied to 83 positions, reworked my resume twice, ended up making my own website for my projects just to look better on paper, and got 5 interviews at the end of March. I have gotten offers so far from every place I interviewed at and used the smaller offers to ask Amazon to give me a decision earlier, which ended up working. I only did 2 interviews with Amazon before I got my team and offer, which from reading online isn't common as they usually have a 3rd or 4th interview for interns. Its been a long process and a battle at every stage.

"I got 4 Data Science job offers with salaries between $100k - $150k in a single week, and I have a degree in English Literature",umse6v,"I have 3 years experience as a Data Analyst and a certificate (not a degree) an online Data Science program. Those are pretty weak credentials, and I'm sure I'm not the only person with that kind of background that starts the job search thinking there's no chance anyone would ever hire me.

I wanted to share what worked for me, just in case it can work for anybody else.

Basically, it's this:

**Treat the job interview like you're selling a service**

What worked for me was to stop thinking of it as a job interview.

Instead, imagine that you're the sales rep for a Data company answering an RFP. A client has a problem and they need a solution. You're just there to demonstrate that you can implement it.

Try to figure out what problem they're trying to solve with this role before the interview begins. That might be something like: ""We have data but we don't know how to get meaning out of it"" or ""We need to re-architect our data"" or even just: ""We have a guy who does a great job, but we need two of him.""

Center everything you say around the key message of: ""I know what your problem is and I know how to solve it.""

When they ask you to tell them about yourself:

1. Focus your answer on demonstrating that you have experience solving problems like theirs
2. Wrap it up by saying you were interested in the job because you got the impression that they need that problem solved, and you have a lot of experience solving that problem
3. Ask the interviewer if you're on the right about what problem they need solved

It's fine if you've totally misread the company. The point is that, when you ask that question, early in the interview, you force the interviewer to explain what they want the person who takes the role to be able to do.

It also switches the whole dynamic of the interview. Instead of them asking you questions, it's now about you troubleshooting that problem.

Respond by:

1. Asking clarifying questions about the problem they have
2. Explaining how you would approach the problem
3. Describing past similar projects you've worked on and how you solved them
4. Highlighting the business impact of your solutions

Doing this made a *massive* difference in my job search. I didn't hear back from any job I applied to until I tried this approach, but I heard back from everybody after I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/umse6v/i_got_4_data_science_job_offers_with_salaries/,takenorinvalid,1863,Career,293,Top - all

My Guide To Writing A Killer Cover Letter,tag8l5,"Most people think a cover letter is about themselves. This isn’t true.

A cover letter is a marketing tool. Treat it like one and you’ll see it do wonders. Treat it like an autobiography and you’ll wonder why no one gets back to you.

Here’s the cover letter formula that got me my current job:

1. **Analyzing the job description**
2. **Identifying what to include in your cover letter**
3. **Why do you want to work here?**
4. **Writing the cover letter**

**Before we get started:** this is a long post (\~3000 words). If you'd rather get a free PDF copy of it, feel free to [drop your email](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) here and I'll be sending it next week. 

**1/ Analyzing the job description**

Always write a cover letter from scratch. It's better to apply for five relevant positions with a complementing cover letter than to apply for fifty positions without any background research.

The best way to do this is to start by analyzing the job description.

A job description is composed of two parts:

1. What you’ll do
2. What the company is looking for (i.e qualifications)

First, focus on the “what you’ll do” portion. The first few bullets are the most important. And we need to make sure that they’re addressed in our cover letter. Start highlighting the ones you have experience carrying out.

https://preview.redd.it/pbakyc28yem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3a2be51ee0c9d009f81068868ee28064271904

Next, take a look at the qualifications. Note down the ones you can comfortably meet and ignore any you don’t. We also want to highlight the ‘preferred’ or ‘nice-to-have’ items listed in the job posting if you satisfy those.

*Quick note: Qualifications are always negotiable and should never deter you from applying if you think you’re almost there but missing a few requirements.*

https://preview.redd.it/s1yfj6n9yem81.png?width=3424&format=png&auto=webp&s=282abefe6281837a26d748131dbb9aca1daba54d

Make sure to note all these skills you’ve highlighted in the job description down. We’re now ready to move onto our next step.

**2/ Identifying what to include in your cover letter**

Create a table with two columns. In the left column jot down the highlighted skills you identified in the above section. And now in the right column, start writing down how you can match up to the advertised qualifications.

Here’s an example for my latest role. Notice how I try to use as many of the same words as the job description:

https://preview.redd.it/xhalvb7byem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=76992f4e46b66a259504c8fb0bcc2f1ec6fca3ab

For now, just put down the qualifications without any regard for style. Also, you don’t need qualifications for all the requirements. We’re only going to use the top two anyway.

Struggling to come up with qualifications? Try to ask your co-workers or peers about projects they’ve enjoyed working with you on. Keeping a [brag document](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) can also be really helpful.

And try to speak the employer’s language. So if a job description mentions “QuickBooks,” don’t just say you’ve used “accounting software”.

**3/ Why do you want to work here?**

You’re a great fit for the role. Now you have to convince them that you want to work there.

Realize that this is just a research based question. If you do enough research, you will find information about the company that you can link back to your own interests and goals.

To help you do research, ask yourself the following questions:

* What is the company’s mission?
* What problem are they trying to solve?
* What’s the product?
* What’s unique about this company compared to its competitors?
* What are some policies or values that the company has that they feature on their homepage?
* Describe any of the organization’s community engagement projects or employee development programs.

A great place to find more info is to look at interviews that their founders or executives have done. Another is the company’s blog.

Once you’ve done your research, list out *why* you find each answer to the above questions appealing. What is it about rockets that appeals to you? Why is a video messaging platform one you can connect with?

And if you’ve been using their product, that enthusiasm will shine through. It’s not mandatory and it’s not even common, but when it does happen, you have a great reason for why you want to work at the company.

*Sidenote: I'm going to release a complete guide on researching companies before the interview soon. If you'd like to read that you can* [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *here* *and get it when it's released.*

**4/ Writing the cover letter**

We’re going to use the following format for your cover letter:

*(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in.*

*(ii) Transition*

*(iii). Skill & Qualification Match*

*(vi) Why do you want to work there?*

*(v) Conclusion*

***(i) Who you are, what you want, and what you believe in***

Use the first one or two sentences to make some statements about who you are, what you want, and what you believe in. Here are some good examples:

https://preview.redd.it/7tjx90ueyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c769a4c46e74c14d1b52b995177237b3569ba76

Emphasize your strengths and also ideally mention something specific to the company.

***(ii) Transition***

I like to link the intro in my cover letter to the first skill-qualification match by having a summary statement and attaching it to a generic sentence:

https://preview.redd.it/65imjsigyem81.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=edfa8b0ec98b32708cca1db7b2c56c1b46b6fde5

The first sentence summarizes what you will bring to the company. The second helps flow into the experiences you’re about to write about.

Mine would be:

*Over the last 12 months, I’ve helped my company generate over $X in revenue by leading meetings with executive leaders and also built a variety of web applications on the side.*

*And now I’m excited to continue my journey by contributing and growing at Adyen. There are three things that make me the perfect fit for this position:*

Here are some examples that differentiate weak and better summary statements:

https://preview.redd.it/2hssbb2iyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=09585eef6003225bfc97c0cd38d5dc122af93b0a

Avoid jargon and get specific. Half the words, twice the examples. Ideally with a few numbers sprinkled in.

*Quick Note: The summary statement is also great to add to the top of your Linkedin bio.*

***(ii) Skill & Qualification Match***

Go back to your table matching your qualifications to the requirements. Pick the two most important ones.

We’re going to link your qualifications to a theme. And then use that to transform your boring bullet points into exciting sentences.

Here are eight common interview story themes:

1. Leading People
2. Taking initiative
3. Affinity for challenging work
4. Affinity for different types of work
5. Affinity for specific work
6. Dealing with failure
7. Managing conflict
8. Driven by curiosity

Let's say we ended up with the below table when analyzing a specific job description.

https://preview.redd.it/5zl2adfkyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=da38789ff4180a422a237027d1dd4827993f1dca

And let’s take our first qualification:

*Conducted Feature-Mapping and Requirements Gathering sessions with prospective and existing clients to formulate Scope and Backlog. Responsible for managing and creating backlog, writing stories and acceptance criteria for all managed projects.*

Let’s figure out how we can link this to one of the interview story themes:

https://preview.redd.it/mikhhw0myem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8057bf24031ebb66a10d21aac45f5f5836bf6ed8

And here's another example:

https://preview.redd.it/otukv2rnyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d242ebd6f3764b64ce49d530a8a22df03ddfad97

So what we’ve done here is abstracted some themes from this person’s actual qualifications.

I know this isn't super scientific. More themes than just one work for most qualifications. But the goal is to help you solidify the type of story you want to tell.

And now that you have your theme, you can use it to guide your body paragraphs using this format:

https://preview.redd.it/hkdahc9pyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7003513dacbe9704ed3a8b8c430f1932d4d0706a

Some more examples:

https://preview.redd.it/cql1thksyem81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=663d5c64f7cc9d4e63fcd37fdf0bda1358ebbdfc

***(vi) Why do you want to work there?***

Pick your two most favorite aspects about the company that you already found when doing your research. I like to pick one value driven one and one industry or current topic related. If you use their product, though, that should be first on your list.

If you want to check out some examples for this, you can do that [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.32.png), [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.40.png), and [here](https://careerfairss.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cover_letter_guide/Screenshot+2022-03-07+at+23.30.48.png).

Now that you’ve got two reasons, it’s time to craft together a simple paragraph that weaves them together:

*Third, I’ve been following \[COMPANY\] for a couple of months now and I resonate with both the company’s values and its general direction. The \[Insert Value\] really stands out to me because \[Insert Reason\]. I also recently read that \[Insert topical reason\] and this appeals to me because \[Why it appeals to you\].*

Realize that this part is your chance to bring out what you like about the company. And if you can’t really think of anything, maybe you need to rethink why you’re actually applying.

***(vi) Conclusion***

Simply state what you want and why you want it:

*I think you’ll find that my experience is a really good fit for \[COMPANY\] and specifically this position. I’m ready to take my skills to the next level with your team and look forward to hearing back.*

*Thanks,*

*Your name*

**Putting it together**

Combing everything, here’s what my cover letter for my current job looked like:

https://preview.redd.it/i4whem84zem81.png?width=4236&format=png&auto=webp&s=60072e121835415cbfa0f3706c91ad2faad5b1bf

And voila. You now have all the tools to write a killer cover letter.

Friendly reminder not to work too hard. You'll just get fired,1afgvv9,"The year just started and there are already over 50K layoffs. The latest one is UPS, including some data professionals at corporate. These are people who worked hard, built a career with the company over extremely long period of time, stayed loyal, 3% merit increases, worked extra hours because they believed that they were contributing to a better future for the company and themselves.... And they were laid off without a second thought for cost saving. Yeah, Because that makes so much sense, right?

How to get a job in data science - a semi-harsh Q/A guide.,qph4tx,"**HOW DO I GET A JOB IN DATA SCIENCE?**

Hey you. Yes you, person asking ""how do I get a job in data science/analytics/MLE/AI whatever BS job with data in the title?"". I got news for you. There are two simple rules to getting one of these jobs.

1. Have experience.

2. Don't have no experience.

There are approximately 1000 entry level candidates who think they're qualified because they did a 24 week bootcamp for every entry level job. I don't need to be a statistician to tell you your odds of landing one of these aren't great.

**HOW DO I GET EXPERIENCE?**

Are you currently employed? If not, get a job. If you are, figure out a way to apply data science in your job, then put it on your resume. Mega bonus points here if you can figure out a way to attribute a dollar value to your contribution. Talk to your supervisor about career aspirations at year-end/mid-year reviews. Maybe you'll find a way to transfer to a role internally and skip the whole resume ignoring phase. Alternatively, network. Be friends with people who are in the roles you want to be in, maybe they'll help you find a job at their company.

**WHY AM I NOT GETTING INTERVIEWS?**

IDK. Maybe you don't have the required experience. Maybe there are 500+ other people applying for the same position. Maybe your resume stinks. If you're getting 1/20 response rate, you're doing great. Quit whining. 

**IS XYZ DEGREE GOOD FOR DATA SCIENCE?**

Does your degree involve some sort of non-remedial math higher than college algebra? Does your degree involve taking any sort of programming classes? If yes, congratulations, your degree will pass most base requirements for data science. Is it the best? Probably not, unless you're CS or some really heavy math degree where half your classes are taught in Greek letters. Don't come at me with those art history and underwater basket weaving degrees unless you have multiple years experience doing something else.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ BOOTCAMP/MICROMASTERS?**

Do you have experience? No? This ain't gonna help you as much as you think it might. Are you experienced and want to learn more about how data science works? This could be helpful.

**SHOULD I DO XYZ MASTER'S IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAM?**

Congratulations, doing a Master's is usually a good idea and will help make you more competitive as a candidate. Should you shell out 100K for one when you can pay 10K for one online? Probably not. In all likelihood, you're not gonna get $90K in marginal benefit from the more expensive program. Pick a known school (probably avoid really obscure schools, the name does count for a little) and you'll be fine. Big bonus here if you can sucker your employer into paying for it.

**WILL XYZ CERTIFICATE HELP MY RESUME?**

Does your certificate say ""AWS"" or ""AZURE"" on it? If not, no.

**DO I NEED TO KNOW XYZ MATH TOPIC?**

Yes. Stop asking. Probably learn probability, be familiar with linear algebra, and understand what the hell a partial derivative is. Learn how to test hypotheses. Ultimately you need to know what the heck is going on math-wise in your predictions otherwise the company is going to go bankrupt and it will be all your fault. 

**WHAT IF I'M BAD AT MATH?**

Git gud. Do some studying or something. MIT opencourseware has a bunch of free recorded math classes. If you want to learn some Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang is your guy. 

**WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SHOULD I LEARN?**

STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION. I CAN GOOGLE ""HOW TO BE A DATA SCIENTIST"" AND EVERY SINGLE GARBAGE TDS ARTICLE WILL TELL YOU SQL AND PYTHON/R. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE JOY OF SEGMENTATION FAULTS TO RUN A SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. 

**SHOULD I LEARN PYTHON OR R?**

Both. Python is more widely used and tends to be more general purpose than R. R is better at statistics and data analysis, but is a bit more niche. 
Take your pick to start, but ultimately you're gonna want to learn both you slacker.

**SHOULD I MAKE A PORTFOLIO?**

Yes. And don't put some BS housing price regression, iris classification, or titanic survival project on it either. Next question.

**WHAT SHOULD I DO AS A PROJECT?**

IDK what are you interested in? If you say twitter sentiment stock market prediction go sit in the corner and think about what you just said. Every half brained first year student who can pip install sklearn and do model.fit() has tried unsuccessfully to predict the stock market. The efficient market hypothesis is a thing for a reason. There are literally millions of other free datasets out there you have one of the most powerful search engines at your fingertips to go find them. Pick something you're interested in, find some data, and analyze it. 

**DO I NEED TO BE GOOD WITH PEOPLE?** (courtesy of /u/bikeskata)

Yes! First, when you're applying, no one wants to work with a weirdo. You should be able to have a basic conversation with people, and they shouldn't come away from it thinking you'll follow them home and wear their skin as a suit. Once you get a job, you'll be interacting with colleagues, and you'll need them to care about your analysis. Presumably, there are non-technical people making decisions you'll need to bring in as well. If you can't explain to a moderately intelligent person why they should care about the thing that took you 3 days (and cost $$$ in cloud computing costs), you probably won't have your position for long. You don't need to be the life of the party, but you should be pleasant to be around.

Here are the questions I was asked for my entry level DS job!,xbl58o,"Hey everyone. I posted a thread a few days ago about being nervous about my first DS interview. The thread was taken down by mods due to it being more appropriate for the stickied thread. So I want to make this thread less about questions, but more of an informative post to show you some of the questions I was asked. Hopefully it's helpful for newbies and veterans alike!

&#x200B;

**SQL:**

* What is a view?
* Is a table dynamic or static?
* Difference between a primary key and foreign key
* Inner Join vs. Left Join scenario (pretty sure it was from w3schools. ez pz)
* WHERE vs. HAVING
* When would you use a subquery? Provide an example
* How would you improve the performance of a slow query?
* EDIT: Some aggregation and GROUP by questions (MAX, AVG, COUNT, etc.) that I just remembered.

**Python**

* Explanation of libraries I use (Pandas mainly)
* How would you get the maximum result from a list?
* Can you explain the concept of functions
* Difference between FOR and WHILE loops?
* Give some examples of how you would clean dirty data.

**Tableau:**

* What is a calculated field? Provide some examples in your work
* What is the difference between a live view and extract? When would you use each?
* More information given on the data I work with

**Statistics:**

* Explain what a p-value is to someone who has no idea what that is.
* Explanation on linear/logistic regression modeling.
* What is standard deviation? Examples?
* Difference between STDEV and Variance?
* What statistics do you currently work with? (Descriptive mainly... mean, median, mode, stdev, confidence intervals)

I advanced to round 3 immediately, which is pretty much a shoe-in according to the hiring manager. I am very excited because it seems like a great opportunity. Even if I don't get it, I still felt like I interviewed very well and did my best. I am very proud of myself.

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

"I just explained recall/precision to a non-DS, and he got it immediately",qdai89,"Explain it like fishing with a net. You use a wide net, and catch 80 of 100 total fish in a lake. That's 80% recall. But you also get 80 rocks in your net. That means 50% precision, half of the net's contents is junk. You could use a smaller net and target one pocket of the lake where there are lots of fish and no rocks, but you might only get 20 of the fish in order to get 0 rocks. That is 20% recall and 100% precision.

"The Key Word in Data Science is Science, not Data",p7hpd9,"I know reddit doesn't represent real life, but just look at the titles of this sub. They're all about tools, code languages/packages, and algorithms. I think to most aspiring data scientists, that's how they see the profession. You're given a tech stack, some data, and your goal is to apply x tool/algorithm to y data. My argument is this is only going to work at super junior levels, and I believe it's the reason why there's a huge oversupply of junior data scientists but teams still can't find competent seniors.  


As another experiment, just head over to r/dataisbeautiful right now. You'll see a ton of different techs used to generate some decent and some awful visualizations. All of those people were able to access, clean, and plot data. There's no shortage of people who can do that. But what you'll notice if you read that sub, is there's a huge lack of people thinking critically about the data they're working with, and that's the science aspect.

&#x200B;

I feel like every week there's a new topic here on how long until data scientists are obsolete. I don't think data scientists are getting less valuable, but people who can just use tool x to leverage data y are. Why would I hire a senior data scientist to create a dashboard when I can teach an intern tableau and get 95% of the same thing? Whether it's recognizing Simpson's paradox, knowing when to keep/stop digging into research questions, figuring out when gathering more data is necessary, knowing how to communicate findings in ways that make an impact, the science part of data science is by far the most valuable. Some people call them soft skills, but I'm not a huge fan of the term. It's science. Unfortunately these are the toughest skills to learn and also the toughest skills to interview for, so I don't suspect you'll see companies steering away from technical questions in interviews any time soon. But mastering the science aspect of data science is I believe the best way to make yourself extremely valuable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/p7hpd9/the_key_word_in_data_science_is_science_not_data/,None,1300,Discussion,155,Top - all

The support from that was incredible, and I thought I’d share an update.

Since then, I’ve gone through a dozen interviews, ranging from FANG to startups to MBB, and updated the cheatsheet with topics I’ve seen covered in actual interviews.

Improvements include:

* Added Time Series
* Added Statistics
* Added A/B Testing
* Improved Distribution Section
* Added Multi-class SVM
* Added HMM
* Miscellaneous Section
* And a bunch of other small changes scattered throughout!

These topics, along with the material covered previously, are all condensed in a convenient five-page Data Science Cheatsheet, found [here](https://github.com/aaronwangy/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

I’ll be heading to a FANG company as a DS after graduation, and I hope this cheatsheet is helpful to those on the job hunt or just looking to brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star/save the repo for reference and future updates!

I investigated the Underground Economy of Glassdoor Reviews,13ilm03,"Online company reviews are high stakes.

Top reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception.

Employers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious.

These reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place.

The scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs.

Whilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day.

In this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want “better” results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars.

The supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.

Many of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month.

Some of these run such sophisticated operations that they’ve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering.

Others operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they’re able to take a negative review down.

The underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we’re going to find out how it operates.

**Adding reviews**

The barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that’s where we’ll start.

To write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don’t need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address).

I went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company’s online presence.

Within minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:

https://preview.redd.it/esx3904qa20b1.png?width=3064&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff3a2f8528fee99aabb830f27ea71a7569ebb2e

After a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$10 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #2|$35 per original review, $20 per already created review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #3|$25 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #4|$25 per review|Monthly|10 reviews|
|Freelancer #5|$20 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Online Reputation Management Agency|$300 subscription|Monthly|8 reviews|

Let’s dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered.

Freelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n1ddox6cb20b1.png?width=2684&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c271d0eec4328cb78d7d2cb85dfffa3f9eb72f8

In another message, he tells me he’s offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:

5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month

Considering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that’s not bad change at all.

One of the companies that he’s offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won’t name the company, but here’s what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/2np5b6fdb20b1.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cafaa85453b0933a18eb5c30f931b3bb893c46

5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company’s total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad.

But here’s the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don’t look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don’t come in “spikes” – more on this later) and they also make sure that they’re not always leaving the “cons” section blank.

Don’t get me wrong, if you come across this company’s reviews, it’d be pretty easy to tell they’re quite strange. In fact, I can’t even post some screenshots here because it’d give the company away immediately.

But it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews.

The same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews.

Sidenote: I got curious about how he’s been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address – doesn’t Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP?

One of the freelancers answered my question:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4id2yqeb20b1.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2a77fdea8834a6d90f02b8b3eb67b3a874f3df2

Moving on – another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/99fdvcgfb20b1.png?width=3116&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e244529fc62b5c824d925feb61fd2cc16cbfd5

Based on this [Glassdoor webinar](https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2018, “if it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted” – so likely Glassdoor’s content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.

So far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:

* Spacing the fake reviews out
* Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)
* Using language that isn’t an obvious giveaway

On that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers’ first language is not English.

As an experiment, I turned to everybody’s favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review:

https://preview.redd.it/8w7cal9gb20b1.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=860c39b11c5813e8b7fabdbb038d73c565cc98cf

And I’d say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across.

**Removing reviews**

The process for removing an employer review usually works like this:

1. You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed
2. You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there’s something else about the review(s) that could get it removed.
3. You file an appeal to get it removed.

As an example, Glassdoor’s Review guidelines can be found [here](https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job). Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who’s not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.

Sounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6s8hsyac20b1.png?width=2036&format=png&auto=webp&s=f86c386f864198dc43faeb41faea378090c20107

After some research, I summarized the different vendors and prices in the table below:

&#x200B;

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|Self reported success rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$100 per review|3 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Freelancer #2|$30 per review|7 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #2|$450 per review|21 business days|Contingency Agreement Model|Unknown|
|Reputation management service #3|$1000 per review|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 1|$550 per review|5-6 weeks|Contingency Agreement Model|50-75%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 2|$300 Subscription + $100 per each review removed|Monthly service|Subscription plan|50-75%|
|Freelancer #3|$20|Undefined|Pay regardless|Undefined|
|Freelancer #4|$500|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|Undefined|

As you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed.

At one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).

**Analyzing reviews**

ReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter) that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is:

* A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews.
* Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons
* Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)

Whilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies’ reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.

After a couple of days, I have the ability to track review volume and review ratings over time for any company that I specify:

https://preview.redd.it/ehcbw2oje20b1.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=b448ff35eb9878fbb1686de2fa8cf031e4ed3e05

Let the games begin.

## Voluntary Response Bias

One of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias.

Research shows many of today’s most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.

Think about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.

On the other hand, if you’ve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.

Consider when a company goes through layoffs. You’re going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a “spike” in reviews.

**Note:** Just like the Wall Street Journal’s methodology described [here](https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0), I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.

Let’s take the company below. Here’s a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/n6kd9ejle20b1.png?width=3216&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eea2f3836617feca37eb88b1d3f67c8fa1b6fe2

In June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off).

Here’s another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4vcnr1ine20b1.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3877fb315ccc5d9a9294306a9f86616cb0fabd2

This company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.

**Note:** Glassdoor does state (based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their “give to get policy” has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized.

I can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don’t try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience.

## Goodhart’s Law

Goodhart’s law states the following:

*""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure""*

Every October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking.

In a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977) that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain & Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline.

I decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor’s 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.

One of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let’s refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.

Here is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4e656zkqe20b1.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=07141a66c56be7a6818efb9b1a4d912ee0021c91

FunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews.

FunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was \~75%.

Both the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.

I find it strange that Glassdoor’s proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor’s eligibility criteria for the award, it’s as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/hag04y7se20b1.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2b920e126a8ea42b40d35aaa55d5341e69d022

The goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect “authentic and unbiased reviews”.

Whilst there’s nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting ""unbiased and authentic"" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).

Glassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to “coerce” them. Examples of what you can’t do:

* Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.
* Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.
* Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.

It is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews.

They say that you shouldn’t hate the player but the game – I think **FunPlaceToWork** played by the rules, won fair and square, and that this is simply a perfect example of Goodhart’s Law.

I reached out to Glassdoor ([awards@glassdoor.com](mailto:awards@glassdoor.com)) about the above and this is the reply I got:

https://preview.redd.it/x0dqq39ue20b1.png?width=4800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0102c963be9486370b340f2f473cbc6650fc48a

**Conclusion**

When I was 22, on an [F1 visa with 3 months to find work](https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story), I didn’t give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I’d sign any piece of paper you put in front of me.

Compare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an “A-Player”, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews.

For most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there’s a concept of a “marketing touchpoint” - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.

Company reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn’t afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one.

After all, when others start to game the system, you’re at a disadvantage if you don’t. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.

HR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren’t always paying attention.

The result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy.

One that ends up hurting the job seeker.

"Data Science and Data Analytics is becoming ultra glorified / romanticized, and I don't think people are really told what they are getting into.",nue01q,"I honestly, don't think people wanting to break into Data Science really know what all it entails. It just sounds good, and sounds like it will make them lots of money.

No one tells people what comes with the job. There are a lot of headaches that come with it, and you have to be a very patient person.

When any person starts out in IT, they learn some psychology. How to manage users and their expectations. You learn what to say and what not to say. You learn how to appear confident and reassuring even if you're getting up to speed in the moment. The good ones do anyway.

Data Science, BI, DA - you have to have those skills multiplied by ten. You have to be better than the rest at managing expectations. You have to learn how to avoid support drains, and be thinking ahead all of the time.

The data science people are the only people I respect as much as the people in Systems. Because other fields, you learn one thing and only one side of it, call yourself an engineer despite knowing one side. Sys Engineers have to know a little about everything and base knowledge in all kinds of things/ They are constantly growing. Data Science folks are similar because they have to know a wide assortment of things, and they have to know all of the tips and tricks at their disposal to get their desired result. Which means they will know Python, multiple types of SQL, Pandas, Jupyter, and so on. They'll pivot in Excel in a pinch if they need to.

But the main reason I respect them is just because of how patient they have to be to want to work in their field for 30+ years.

Our DA left in 2018 and one of my roles was a senior DBA, so they just put her job on top of mine. I learned a lot and I got very good at SQL and streamlining and reducing task turn around for reports and data tasks. But I obviously didn't have the time to dive ultra deep into the rabbit hole, and I didn't want to. Because I knew it wasn't for me.

We were acquired, and I transitioned all of that stuff onto the BI team of the new company. I have so much respect for those people. I am still answering questions and taking one off requests. This morning I was just hit in the face with how much I dislike actually doing he DS/DA side. A Sales Senior Manager needed something with some data. I asked a follow up question. I needed a key piece of info to ensure I did the right thing and didn't have to do re work later. They said they would get it to me later.

They emailed it to me at 7:11am this morning, then messaged me before my shift - ""Hey, I don't see the data task with the blah blah being done. We needed it 6/3."" And I am thinking - then why wait until 6/7 to give me the info. We got the request 6/4, and I asked you on 6/4, then you waited the weekend to get it to me.

And those individuals who just keep coming back telling you the data wasn't what they expected or wanted when it is what they asked for.. I'm so happy to be just a senior sys engineer again working on large scale infra.

It's not for everyone, and I think they need to talk about and teach managing expectations so you don't shoot yourself in the foot. Luckily the BI team of the new company are phenomenal, and now I am out of the game. 

But I am learning more Python at home in my spare time and things like Jupyter so I don't regress skill wise. Python is useful in what I do anyway.

Plotting? Built into Excel. Aggregation? Built into Excel. Transformer-based natural language embeddings? Not built into Excel, and thus not important. While you were religiously watching Coursera videos, I was learning from Steve Balmer’s every move. That man knew how to deliver business insight using actionable intelligence. 

I’m all about the North Star metrics. I align with the business leaders. I distill all day.

Dweebs on my team keep talking about “controlling for multiple hypotheses” and “effect sizes.”  Is it an Excel function? No?

You can’t have a deep understanding of every Data Science field. Either have a shallow knowledge of many disciplines (consultant), or specialize in one or two (specialist). Time is not infinite.  


You can’t do practical Data Science, and discover new methods at the same time. Either you solve existing problems using existing tools, or you spend years developing a new one. Time is not infinite.  


You can’t work on many projects concurrently. You have only so much attention span, and so much free time you use to think about solutions.

Linear Regression is underrated,1avoc19,"Hey folks,

Wanted to share a quick story from the trenches of data science. I am not a data scientist but engineer however I've been working on a dynamic pricing project where the client was all in on neural networks to predict product sales and figure out the best prices using overly complicated setup. They tried linear regression once, didn't work magic instantly, so they jumped ship to the neural network, which took them days to train.

I thought, ""Hold on, let's not ditch linear regression just yet."" Gave it another go, dove a bit deeper, and bam - it worked wonders. Not only did it spit out results in seconds (compared to the days of training the neural networks took), but it also gave us clear insights on how different factors were affecting sales. Something the neural network's complexity just couldn't offer as plainly.

Moral of the story? Sometimes the simplest tools are the best for the job. Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees might seem too basic next to flashy neural networks, but it's quick, effective, and gets straight to the point. Plus, you don't need to wait days to see if you're on the right track.

So, before you go all in on the latest and greatest tech, don't forget to give the classics a shot. Sometimes, they're all you need.

Cheers!

"To All ""Data Scientists"" out there, Crowdsourcing COVID-19",fm17ja,"Recently there's massive influx of ""teams of data scientists"" looking to crowd source ideas for doing an analysis related task regarding the SARS-COV 2 or COVID-19.

I ask of you, please take into consideration data science is only useful for exploratory analysis at this point. Please take into account that current common tools in ""data science"" are ""bias reinforcers"", not great to predict on fat and long tailed distributions. The algorithms are not objective and there's epidemiologists, virologists (read data scientists) who can do a better job at this than you. Statistical analysis will eat machine learning in this task. Don't pretend to use AI, it won't work.

Don't pretend to crowd source over kaggle, your data is old and stale the moment it comes out unless the outbreak has fully ended for a month in your data. If you have a skill you also need the expertise of people IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE. If your best work is overfitting some algorithm to be a kaggle ""grand master"" then please seriously consider studying decision making under risk and uncertainty and refrain from giving advice.

Machine learning is label (or bias) based, take into account that the labels could be wrong that the cleaning operations are wrong. If you really want to help, look to see if there's teams of doctors or healthcare professionals who need help. Don't create a team of non-subject-matter-expert ""data scientists"". Have people who understand biology.

Please STOP asking Data Scientists about Leetcode questions meant for Software Engineers for job interviews,lkn4rl,"I've been working as a Data Scientist long enough to say that asking Leetcode questions for Data Scientists is completely disrespectful. This is both for both product and ML-based data scientists.

Something simple is fine, like hashmaps, two pointers, strings, some light algorithms etc. But graph theories, DFS with trees/dynamic programming has nothing to do with data analytics, ML fundamentals, statistical foundations, and data storytelling competence.

I really don't understand. When you have a wealth of ways to distinguish competent Data Scientists from juniors during interview pipeline (complicated SQL, pandas, data munging, visualization, ML training, building simulation code, etc.), why you'd rather choose questions like ""how many moves do you need to get a Queen chess piece from this position to another on a chessboard"" as a way of measuring how well a Data Scientist would perform analytics or ML training on the job. It really just feels like SWEs making fun of Data Scientists about how poor programmers we are.

Most companies don't pull crap like this, but for those who do, PLEASE STOP. Unless we received a BA or MA in computer science -- which majority if not most of us did not -- we won't be able to solve shit like this unless we cheat and look at answers directly on leetcode or geekforgeeks. And it's infuriating and embarrassing for us to sink to this kind of level to solve questions that aren't meant for us. I get that Data people need to know programming, but WE AREN'T SWEs, and DS is not SWE.

**Edit**: I'm getting a lot of replies saying that I suck at programming and I need to learn SWE fundamentals. I said over and over that I'm not against understanding foundations of SWE (hashmaps, runtime, pointers, optimized solutions vs brute force). These are important. But when you get into highly niched algorithm named after somebody where you need to do some complicated tricks or build a whole system that requires multiple functions, DFS-based dynamic programming, multiple inheritance methods all in 45 minutes that would unnerve even seasoned SWEs out of practice, that's when it becomes totally unreasonable, outside the realm of data science, and just disrespectful to what Data Scientists do on a daily basis. But that's the line I draw, and the overall question is: at what point do interview questions become unjustifiable and unrelated to the position at hand? I've spent years using pandas, scikit-learn, tableau, and complicated SQL for daily data tasks. Why is it that you can't test me on this stuff which occurs on day-to-day basis for majority of data scientists?

**Edit Edit:** Btw, shame on those of you just downvoting everything I'm saying without reading any of it (I can't even locate my own comments anymore). It's immature and completely ridiculous.

I’m so sick of corporate morons,npurud,"[RANT]

Hey gang, stand back, it’s rant time. 

Analytics is a new field at my work, and I’m here to pioneer it. I work In corporate at a large medical devices company. 

I’ve had the luxury of an amazing boss, some amazing colleagues, and decent budget. 

But for the love of fucking god... I am so sick of being thrown responsibility or projects because good ol mary in sales watched a video on “gesture recognition”. The ideas are a great, and I have a framework for filtering them, but the fucking pressure, the initiation of projects with 0 data, no aim at data collection, no quality assurance or risk management and the icing on the cake, “we should roll out an MVP in 2 months”. What in gods name is that shit? 

I’m the asshole. I’m always the asshole. 
“Here are my requirements if we wish to complete this project in the given time frame.” 
“So... why can’t you develop it now?”
Bro... for starters, I’m not a full fledged software engineer / deep learning god.

Landing a Senior Data Scientist Job After 6 Months of Unemployment,k7iytr,"I graduated this year with a masters of statistics. In this article, I will explain the process that ultimately led to my offer for a **Senior Data Scientist ** position for a company in the SF Bay Area. The components of the process that led to my success, in no particular order, were: crafting my resume and LinkedIn, building skills and projects, staying motivated (during the pandemic), decoding the data science interview process, and determining my professional goals.

(**EDIT // Important Note: this is not big N or FAANG, since in the comments people are using top top companies to benchmark my experience**)

## Preface 

As with any statistical inference, a singleton dataset won't yield robustness. I was an unusual applicant to my grad program, and am an unorthodox candidate for DS roles, which is why it took me six months to find a job while my peers all had several offers immediately following graduation (and some months in advance!). I worked for 6 years between my undergrad and masters in the nonprofit world and had many different job titles, as noted in Edit #2 below. Coming back to school was a huge pivot and career shift, and so I am extremely fortunate to have found a firm who recognized the unique strengths I bring to the table; I was also extremely fortunate to interact with this firm at the right time where my unique strength combination was part of their strategic plan. 

**Takeaway:** My experience is not a modal experience, but the tools I used and the lessons I learned may be useful for others. I would have appreciated reading it two years ago, so I'm putting it here in case others relate. Also a friendly reminders to aspiring or current data scientists not to conflate [prior and posterior probabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/posterior-probability.asp).

## Crafting My Resume and LinkedIn

I completely botched my first DS resume. I borrowed a classmate's resume and used it as a template, and tried to copy what they had done. But they had internships, relevant projects, and a better GPA than me, so my version looked... weird, since I didn't have any of those things. Also, I was still expecting people to ""read between the lines"" on my resume instead of being as clear as possible. I started applying and connecting with folks, and what I am shocked by is that **not one person I asked about my resume gave substantial or useful feedback**. The one useful piece of feedback that I received was from my parents, who remarked ""this doesn't seem to really sell you; you're much better in person than on this paper."" While initially, I was resistant to rehauling my resume, I decided to spend a full week almost full time rehauling my resume. This paid off, because I saw a significant uptick in responses and was able to get several first round interviews. The main changes I made:

- Only put what is relevant to the role you are applying for. Even though I had some impressive accomplishments from other projects or roles, I chose the projects or skills that were relevant to data science. 
- Similar to the [first rule of road-side beet sales](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/3d/b6/193db68d6c65ce5881edcbd84c1e436c.jpg), I put my best features in the top half of my resume. 
- I used Canva to make a visually appealing resume, and later switched to a LaTeX resume template to make my resume more professional looking. This was a very very good decision, and I got so much positive feedback from recruiters and hiring managers after making that change. 
- I used a LaTeX cover letter template to write cover letters, which made it look very official and professional. It was easier to produce because I could just make a new document in overleaf and change small portions in the letter, since it's mostly common across applications, and once you do enough you have even domain specific and role specific letters ready to go.

**Takeaway:** your image matters a lot. Make sure to craft it carefully, and tailor it for roles that you are really interested in. 

## Building Skills and Projects

My strategy for learning something is spend at least a week or two finding the best resource, then pay whatever it costs (in your budget) and use it 100%. Don't find 16 free cheat sheets and ""shortcuts"". I researched every resource I could find (many thanks to r/datascience, r/machinelearning, and r/cscareersquestions) and I tried out a few, but saw that many only give free temporary access to some subsection of the entire platform, so you can't really explore past the first few questions or modules. However, I saw a reddit post talking about some site called [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/) where they gave you 7 days for free, but it was full access. I looked through the catalogue and found a lot of what I wanted to learn. I took a week and devoted 8 hours per day to going through the modules. There are some things I would change, but for the most part, it is very well designed, and extremely helpful. I earned somewhere around 20K ""experience"" on the platform, which means I finished \~100-200 exercises from data engineering, modeling, or reviewing OOP in Python. Then at the end of the free trial, they emailed me a 62% coupon for a year's subscription, which brought it down to an insanely reasonable number, like between 100-150 bucks? Easy decision, since I had already mapped my curriculum through the rest of their materials, and they have new courses coming out every 1-2 weeks. 

For textbooks, anything from O'Reily with an animal on the front is probably going to be a good resource. I burned through about a half dozen of those books, taking notes and building the example projects, then moving to DataCamp to do similar projects, then once I felt confident, I would find a dataset from Kaggle or the UCI ML repo and try to carry out the steps, then benchmark my findings with some medium article where someone did the same thing. **Try to keep projects at the center of your learning, then find materials that will add to the project.** This is much more transferrable to a job, and learning to think in this way will help you in interviews. 

I saw an instagram account I follow put out a survey and was getting a lot of responses, but the way they were reporting the data was not able to do full justice to the story they were trying to tell. So I reached out and asked if I could take a look, and they were super excited to have someone with experience weigh in. So I ended up getting a few different spreadsheets, some with categorical and quantitative data and some categorical, while one of the responses was meant for a massively long response (Some users inputted over 1000 words). Do you see where this is going? It's basically a playground where my boss has 0 expectations and all I have to do is improve on autogenerated excel charts. I began cleaning the data in a notebook, then built a set of scripts, then loaded a database, then made a dashboard for the team (using a python flask app), and scheduled cron jobs to extract the data and report results to the ceo/founder of this nonprofit. Every new DataCamp module I completed was one more secret to the puzzle of how to present and improve the data visuals, process, and my code. I got invited to meetings with the other leaders, asked about business decisions, and got to be part of the real life cycle of their mission. 

Now that I had a taste of what that looked like, I reached out to my gym; they keep all of their members data on lifting progress and workout goals in an app, and I was able to give them a fun graphic and report for their members, and they shared on social media and saw an uptick in new memberships! I considered packaging this ""product"" and emailing other gyms, but I got overwhelmed by the pandemic/election and decided to put extra stuff on the back burner and wait for later when I have more skills. 

**Takeaway:** make your learning project driven, and document your entire project, including packaging in several different formats, making a clear write-up, and versions of a verbal explanation that take 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 20 minutes. Then, explain it for a PhD, a CEO, a peer, and a non-technical client (or whatever audiences you want, provided they vary by technical understanding and business investment). Try to carry every project through the finish line. As an example, this post/article is my way of compiling a high-level overview of the job search process--the ""finish line"" of this 6 month project.


## Decoding the Data Science Interview Process

Have you ever been invited to church by your friend, but they didn't explain anything before you got there? You don't know when to raise your hands, or to stand up or sit down, or why the man up front is yelling? That's how I felt for the last 6 months. From when you're supposed to negotiate salary, wtf a ""first year cliff"" is, or what you're allowed to ask and to whom, nobody teaches you this stuff. Why does everything have to be so goddamned awkward and needlessly confusing? I have teaching experience so all of this infuriated me as a very eager learner. 

There are two kinds of people you will encounter: 
- Those who pretend to know the answer, and give you bullshit advice or project onto your experience
- Those who know the answer, but don't know how to explain it, or give equally useless advice like ""just keep applying"". 

Nobody will tell you the truth to your face, or give you meaningful feedback of any kind, and I asked for it *constantly*. They will send you a form email, ghost you, or dodge your questions and judge you for breaking  etiquette **you have no idea about**. 

### My Process

I decided to submit some applications on Linkedin every other day as a benchmark, and took advantage of the ""Easy Apply"" feature to get more applications out. There is a tradeoff between quality and quantity in the applications you send out. Aside from more applications going out, I needed more information, so I decided to use my network to do some decoding.

I went on Facebook, IG, and my LinkedIn and filtered by software, data, CS, analyst etc until I had a list of people to ask questions to. I contacted each of them and asked for a brief phone call to get their advice and to hear about their experience in role R at company C. Here are examples of the questions I asked:

- What are your career goals and how have they changed?
- What are some of the important technologies or libraries to be fluent in as a [their role / your desired role]?
- What helps a candidate stand out when you’re selecting for promotion or advancement?
- What is the culture of [their company] in terms of work / life balance and expectations?
- What does a normal day / week look like?
- What do teams look like and how are projects carried out?
- In risk analytics / Risk dynamics, what are the industry tools?
- For risk analytics, what are differentiators in top analysts?
- What is the culture like?

The final question I always ask is: 

- How do internal referrals work and would you be willing to submit one on my behalf?

I got some first round interviews or conversations with recruiters through this method, but none of the connections panned out, and I only got one technical interview, which was a coding challenge that I answered 5/6 correct, so was not invited to the next round. 

Now that I had exhausted my first round connections, it was time to go to strangers. I went to company pages on LinkedIn and clicked ""people"" and filtered by Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer, then reached out with the following message:

> Subject Line: **[Fellow University Alum]\* wondering about [Company]**
>
>Hey [name], 
>
>My name is [name] and I just finished up at [school] with an [degree] in [major]! I have a background in [sub-filed] and love what I have seen in the job descriptions at [company], and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind connecting and answering some questions I have about the data scientist role and how your experience has been. Thanks so much for your time!
>
>Best, 
>[name]

\* replace ""Fellow University Alum"" with whatever way you can connect with the person based on their profile. Otherwise just say ""Aspiring Data Scientist"" or something humble and eager.

I got several interviews and referrals from strangers this way. 


**Takeaway:** use your network and reach out to make as many connections as possible in order to learn more about what you want or don't want. They may also be happy to refer you to a position.

## Determining My Professional Goals

I interviewed for the following positions: Intern, Research Associate, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Analyst, Analyst, Consultant, Product Manager, and others. 

I talked to a lot of people and wanted to understand what motivates them, what they are experiencing in their role, and what they hope for in the future. What skills do they have, and are those skills transferrable? It seems to me that coding practices and statistical intuition are very transferrable, and so I wanted a role that would allow me to improve those two things. I want to be able to transfer what I learn in my next role to future roles, and I'm not attached to any particular industry. So it was important for me to distinguish myself from those who love coding, or those who want a 9-5 without much challenge, or those who want to do analyst work but don't want to become leaders. Benchmarking and measuring your goals and feelings against others similar to you but in different roles and spaces is an excellent way to figure out what you want to do, and even what size of company you prefer. 

My set of values pre-job offer:

- Any size company, but prefer a medium team size, and a company without too much bureaucracy. 
- Exposure to ML as well as data-wrangling, without too much emphasis on one vs. the other. 
- If I can mentor or help more junior developers, I would enjoy that.
- Have an enjoyable connection to other employees during the interview process.
- If possible, a company that has a meaningful contribution to society, or positive local impact.
- Being able to bring my ideas and whole self to the job, not just a clock-in clock-out situation. 


**Takeaway:** find out what positions interest you, and try to craft your profile, projects, and skills to fit that role. Don't be afraid to say no to positions if they don't meet your criteria.

## Staying Motivated

The 2020 turbulence shook everything that wasn't securely tied down. I've spent much of my free time on calls with friends and family about navigating the challenges they are facing this year. I had weekends and whole weeks where I didn't do anything except scroll on reddit, tiktok, IG, etc. and felt like shit. I had other weeks where I felt like a superhero, learning things and gaining confidence, getting a website to work, debugging part of a data pipeline, etc. Here are the things that helped me stay on track:

- Getting enough nutrients and listening to my body's caloric needs.
- Stretching and foam-rolling when I feel stiff or uncomfortable sitting all day.
- Lifting weights or going for a walk.
- Taking one or two weeks to stop applying because of rejection fatigue.
- Scheduling phone calls with other people in the same boat to commiserate.
- Watching stand up comedy on youtube to crack up and laugh to break the day's tension.
- Limiting doom scrolling and hyper vigilance (our house was 2 miles from one of the fires, so that was hard).
- Any time I needed a nap, I took that nap.

## Giving Back

I was SO LONELY on this journey, and resources on Reddit have helped me massively. As a way to give back to the community, I want to offer the following things for free: 

- A 10-15 minute zoom call to advise you or answer your questions about how to get the Data Science job you're looking for (limited to how many I can fit in next week and who is in dire need). 
- A tailored response to your personal question or situation via email, or advice on how to improve your resume.
- A follow up post on this subreddit answering the top several questions I get.
- Answering as many questions in the comments as I can. I'll reply [""pass""](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-pass-statement-in-python) in some cases, or refer you to resources that were useful to me. 

**Update: Survey now closed. See Edit #5.** 

**Edit #1**: Formatting, added link to [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/)

**Edit #2:** It's an important note that I worked for 6 years in the nonprofit world before coming back to school. Here's a quote from one of my responses below: 
>""I worked in the nonprofit world and had a lot of different roles and responsibilities, including working abroad in a humanitarian capacity, translating for conferences, logistics and operations, participating in making curriculum for staff and volunteers, casting vision to donors in a fund-development capacity, etc. I wish it were a one-liner 'I worked in software' that would be satisfying or succinct, but it is simply more complicated.""

**Edit #3:** Some people are suggesting that my offers to have a zoom call or offer resume feedback are part of some nefarious ploy to obtain people's information or manipulate them in some way. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you know that there are firms who have been scraping employment data from before the sites had adequate protections in place? I interacted with one such company over the course of my research. It would probably be more efficient for me to make a [LinkedIn Recruiter Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a417020/personal-account-vs-recruiter?lang=en#:~:text=LinkedIn%20Recruiter%20is%20a%20talent,of%20active%20and%20passive%20candidates.). Then I could have thousands of emails and LinkedIn profiles all for my nefarious purposes! Muahahahaha! For more stories of recruiting shenanigans, check out r/recruitinghell for best practices. Relevant quote from one of my comments below:
> Hey! I made an edit about this. I had hoped to have some verbal conversations if people were interested, since I have a track record of coaching younger students, teaching, and mentorship. It was the first way I could think to give back to this community aside from writing more posts (which I could certainly do). Is there a method you would suggest that might help that come through more effectively? I definitely don't want to send the wrong message. Thanks!

**Edit #4:** Added Preface section to better contextualize my story.

**Edit #5:** I have closed the survey and will be turning off notifications for this post, following up with the folks who filled out the survey, and writing follow up posts if I get feedback that it will be useful. Thanks to all of you for celebrating with me and helping me make sure this post is as useful for the community as possible! I also received some rather hateful messages, and people disbelieving my story and hard work. I am flattered by your disbelief, because it underscores how incredible my journey has been!

Jut got fired,opnzmc,"Hey, just wanted to share this, as I am feeling a bit down and feeling kinda of a failure. Got fired on my 3rd month.

I got my 1st job after graduating with 2 internships under my belt. I felt I was ready to take on the world.

I started to work for a start up, I moved countries, I was really excited about it but apparently I couldn't present results fast enough or accurate enough.

I always like to assume responsibility, as it is the only way to growth.

On my 1st month I was working with the wrong tables, PMs told me to work with those tables, but those were the wrong tables. I eventually found that I had to request special access to my department's tables... and for some reason those tables were hidden from general view...

2nd and 3rd months I was working with SQL+JSON tables plus all the side tasks. Apparently I did not manage to fully understand the concept of SQL + JSON very well. My numbers were always wrong.

The pandemic hasn't been kind to me (and many others, I know) my focus hasn't been what is used to be, I feel slower, less energetic and less smart.. And the other day I was sent by back to my country, yesterday I broke up with a girl I was seeing... Everything sucks at the moment.

I am not really sure what to do. I like SQL, I like helping business making sense of data, I like doing ad-hocs projects in R or Python. Or at least I thought I did...

I am starting to doubt myself, I feel I am not good enough and that Data might not be for me...

I am sure things will get better, but right now they suck very much.

Thanks for reading

&#x200B;

EDIT: WOW!! Thank you everyone for the support and kind words. It is also refreshing to read other's peopl experience. It makes me feel less alone in this situation. Thank you for the support, it is really amazing, you are all making me feel way better!!! ""YOU DA BEST"" :D

How I achieved a 6-figure base salary Data Scientist job with 1 year of work experience and a bachelor's degree.,u1ivbw,"EDIT: Here is my resume per request. Please don't reverse-engineer this and leak my info somehow, or track this to something connected to me. Trying to do you all a service without it backfiring. [https://ibb.co/zRGqhq0](https://ibb.co/zRGqhq0) I do want to mention that just DOING interviews made me better. My first interviews were a train-wreck. By the end, I felt like an interview expert.

For context, I am 23yo from the US. I have a Math degree from a no-name university, I have taken 0 bootcamps, and I have only taken intro coding courses. I also have some statistics courses under my belt. I have 1 year of relevant work experience and some projects. Let me not undersell myself, but I am far from an expert-level candidate and I have minimal experience.

Here are my tips for getting an interview and job when you're competing with 100s of candidates that all might have more work experience and advanced degrees.

I must first put out that I am a man of faith, so I give God credit. But after that, here are my tips:

**You need a GREAT resume.**

You are competing with advanced degrees and people who probably have much more experience than you. You cannot get away with a bad resume, you simply will be denied immediately. You must do the following:

* Quantify what you did, and how it impacted the business.
* USE KEYWORDS. I don't care if you just touched Keras, put it somewhere on your resume. Some are against this, but use a Skills section at the bottom to include the keywords and then also include them in your highlights. You're looking to at least get an HR interview, your resume will get you there.
* Find a really good-looking template that stands out. Not color, but with formatting.

**Apply Everywhere**

For me, I used LinkedIn exclusively. I did not apply to anything that made me do much more than submit a resume. Its not worth your time. In my experience, take-home coding tests are only worth your time if you've done a series of interviews, it takes 3 hours or less and, the company has shown interest as well.

* Apply even if you're not qualified (not horribly unqualified though). There's flexibility in YOE. I actually got a job interview with somewhere asking for a Masters and 8+ YOE.

**STUDY UP**

* Understand basic statistics. Seriously. Be able to explain every way you'd perform a test and why. What would you do with unbalanced data? Etc.
* Be able to explain a model thoroughly, why would you use it? I was asked to explain loss, variance, bias, what loss function I might use, etc.
* Practice your coding, most of these are in Python
* You must know SQL, preferably advanced-level. I had more SQL coding questions than anything else.

**KNOW YOUR EMPLOYER**

* They WILL ask you case-study questions. You must be able to think outside the box.
* Act super-enthused about their position, even if you are applying elsewhere and its not your #1

**DON'T GIVE UP**

* I submitted easily over 200 applications, received calls on maybe 20 of them, got to the final interviews on 7, was denied on 5, and offered 2.

**MISTAKES I MADE**

* Not remembering my basic statistics, I actually messed up on one interview about ""How would you describe a p-value to a non-technical audience.""
* Not being able to communicate how my projects impacted the company. I have good project experience, but for my first final interview, I had a lot of trouble trying to explain the business impact and how I solved issues. These need to be fresh in your mind.
* Not acting interested. I had at one time, 5 different companies interviewing me and I didn't have much energy to care about each one. This ruined a few of my chances.
* Not studying on the work department. If you are applying to a marketing position, understand a little about marketing... They chose another candidate when I likely would have been chosen had I known a little more background knowledge.

First two weeks of my first internship,nmyg3i,"Today, I got my first paycheck from my first internship and I am shocked about the entire situation. I come from a poor family, I am the first of my family to college (and grad-school) and the first to have a real professional work experience. I honestly feel blessed to be able to improve on my data science abilities and get paid for it! 

I have been working with the lead data scientist and have learned so much in these past two weeks. I enjoy coming to work and even more so now that I saw the paycheck. 

Sorry for the weird post, but I am just in a good mood right now. 

P.s. My boss asked me if I want to continue my internship for the Fall

**Update**
About 330 days have passed since I first started my internship and things couldn’t be better.
I ended up working remotely during the Fall and part of the spring semester but eventually decided to put my two weeks in - no issue with the company nor work, but decided I needed to allocate some more time on school (one course in particular). Luckily, I have been applying for jobs since September and landed an associate Data Scientist position at a large tech company, not FAANG, and start in August 2022. In this past year my life has changed so much and I am truly grateful for every bit of it. I still feel like I don’t deserve this job or that I’m not good enough, but I hope that this imposter syndrome goes away once I start working.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nmyg3i/first_two_weeks_of_my_first_internship/,royal-Brwn,937,Career,71,Top - all

Remember to stop every once in a while and think about how far you've come.,lgiug8,"It's not news to any of us that impostor syndrome is real and that in this field, you'll probably always feel like you don't know anything. But this week, after two years in data science, I finished my first real, entirely self-driven and deployed end-to-end project and, [after publishing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Letterboxd/comments/lfp2h8/as_promised_here_is_a_demo_of_the_recommendation/), I got an e-mail from someone who was excited to learn more about it because they're just starting out on this journey. 

That made me realize that not long ago, I was that person, who would see something like this and have no idea how to do it, but really wanting to know how. And now I do! And of course there are still many things I'm unsure of, completely ignorant of, things I know that I'm doing wrong and things that I don't know that I'm doing wrong - but it feels good to look back and see that I've grown, and that I'm now in the position to help others as others have helped me.

So if you panic or feel helpless when faced with a new, difficult and unfamiliar concept, try to remember that at one point, the things that now come naturally to you also felt that way. And take a second to breathe and realize how far you've come.

I just signed an offer on my first Data Science job,r5thf9,"Hey all, 

Long time lurker of this subreddit. I'm about to graduate with a masters of biomedical data science this may. After an internship with amazon this summer and around 40 applications/15 interviews over the course of the school year I got a job offer from a large tech company. 

The study guides from this subreddit have helped me the whole way through and I genuinely wanted to thank the community again. I started out with an undergraduate degree in biology/stats, and have self taught programming based on the advice given from this sub. I started reading it as a junior in my undergrad as I was trying trying transition from biology to analytics. While sometimes there can be discouraging posts, the advice some users give has really made an impact on me and given me insight into the career field that I was able to use when choosing my courses or finding skills to work on in my free time. 

I come from a very underprivileged background of poverty, paid my way though both my degrees alone, and have struggled with imposter syndrome as a woman in CS. I just want others to know that you don't have to be the best, get straight As or land the first interview to be worthy of a good job. I have really struggled this year and felt terrible about 2 out of my 5 interview rounds but still somehow found myself with a substantial offer letter. 

So this is where I am now. I'm excited, don't even feel like it's real yet, but I'm also anxious for the future and want to prove myself even more. 

I'm not sure if it would be of any help, but I wanted to try and give back to the community. If anyone wants to know my interview experience or my experience with applications I'd be happy to talk about it with them in the comments or DMs. I'll try to get back to as many people as possible if there is interest.

Third-of-ly, I go into specifics about garbage collection and null reference pointers in Python, since, as a DS expert, those will be super relevant and important.  

Last, but not least, need someone who not only knows Python and SQL, but also COBALT and BASIC. 

To give some context, I work in the field of screwing in light bulbs. So we definitely want someone who knows NLP, LLM, CV, CNNs, random forests regression, mixed integer programming, optimization, etc.

Data Science is Seductive,uryrot,"I joined this mid-sized financial industry company (\~500 employees) some time ago as a Dev Manager. One thing lead to another and now I'm a Data Science Manager. 

I am not an educated Data Scientist. No PhD or masters, just a CS degree + 15 years of software development experience, mostly with Python and Java. I always liked analytics and data, and over the years I did a lot of *data sciency* work (e.g: pretty reports with insights, predictions, dashboards, etc...) that management and different stakeholders appreciated a lot. My biggest project, although personal, was a website that would automatically collect covid related data and make predictions on how it will evolve. It was quite a big thing in my country and at one point I had more than 5M views daily. It was entirely a hobby project that went viral, but I learned a lot from it and this is what made me interested in actual data science.

About two years ago, before I joined the company, they started building a Data Science team. They hired a Fortune 500 Data Scientist with a lot of experience under his belt, but not so much management experience. With the help of a more experienced manager, with no relation to Data Science, he had the objective to put together the team and start delivery. In about 6 months the team was ready. It was entirely PhD level. One year later the manager left and so did the team. It's hard for me to say what really happened. Management says they haven't delivered what they were supposed to, while the team was saying the expectations were too high. Probably the truth is somewhere in the middle. As soon as the manager resigned, they asked me directly if I want to build and lead the new team. I was somehow ""famous"" because of the covid website. There was also a big raise involved which convinced me to bypass the *impostor syndrome*. Anyway, I am now leading a new team I put together. 

I had about 50 interviews over the next couple of months. Most of the people I hired were not data scientists per se, but they all knew Python quite well and were **very** detail oriented. Management was somehow surprised on why I'm not hiring PhD level, but they went along with it.

Personally, I hated the fact that most PhDs I've interviewed didn't want to do any data engineering, devops, testing or even reports. I'm not saying that they should be focused on these areas, but they should be able to sometimes do a little bit of them. Especially reports. In my books, as a data scientist you deliver insights extracted from data. Insights are delivered via reports that can take many forms. If you're not capable of reporting the insights you extracted in a way that stakeholders can understand, you are not a data scientist. Not a good one at least...

I started collecting the needs from business and see how they can be solved ""via data science"". They were all over the place. From fraud detection with NLU on e-mails and text recognition over invoices to chatbots and sales predictions. Took me some time to educate them on what low hanging fruits are and to understand what they want without them actually telling me what they want. I mean, most of the stuff they wanted were pure sci-fi level requirements, but in reality what they needed were simple regressions, classifiers and analytics. Some guy wanted to build a chatbot using neural gases, because he saw a cool video about it on youtube.

Less than a month later we went in production with a pretty dashboard that shows some sales metrics and makes predictions on future sales and customer churn. They were all blown away by it and congratulated us for doing it entirely ourselves without asking for any help, especially on the devops side of things. Very important to mention that I had the huge advantage of already understanding how the company works, where the data is and what it means, how the infrastructure is put together and how it can be leveraged. Without this knowledge it would have probably took A LOT longer.

Six months have passed and the team goes quite well. We're making deployments in production every two weeks and management is very happy with our work.

Company has this internship program where grads come in and spend two 3-month long rotations in different teams. After these two rotations some of them get hired as permanent employees. At the beginning of each rotation we have a so called marketplace where each team ""sells"" their work and what a grad can learn from joining the team. They can do front-end, back-end, data engineering, devops, qa, *data science*, etc... They can choose from anything on the software development spectrum. They specify their options in order and then HR decides on where each one goes.

This week was the 3rd time our team was part of the marketplace. And this was the 3rd time ALL grads choose as their first option the data science team. What they don't know is that all previous grads we had in the team decided Data Science is not for them. Their feedback was that there's too much of a hustle to understand the data and that they're not really doing any of the cool AI stuff they've seen on YouTube.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that data science is very seductive. It seduces management to dream for insights that will make them rich and successful, it seduces grads to think they will build J.A.R.V.I.S. and it seduces some data scientists to think it is ok not to do the ""dirty"" work.

At the end of the day, it's just me that got seduced into thinking that it is ok to share this on reddit after a couple of beers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uryrot/data_science_is_seductive/,drake10k,876,Meta,105,Top - all

Can't land a data internship? Try volunteering for a political campaign's data team,m3in2j,"I've seen a few posts about how to find volunteer opportunities, or get experience before you are able to land a full-time job.  One avenue I've used to get experience was volunteering for a political campaign's data team.  Campaigns are ALWAYS looking for extra help, and will usually be happy to assign you some easy data cleaning or analysis tasks that you can use to hone your skills.

To get started, I reached out to the data/tech director for a mid-size PAC (after finding them on LinkedIn) and asked if they had any data volunteering opportunities.  If you can't find this person, reach out to anyone in the campaign and ask if they know who to talk to.  Within a few days they had me sign an NDA and I was working on getting insights out of their textbanking data - figuring out which messaging was working best, weeding out phone numbers that volunteers should have added to the opt-out list but didn't, etc.  

This can be a great way to build a few industry connections, learn some skills about working within real data infrastructure, and have a killer resume bullet point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/m3in2j/cant_land_a_data_internship_try_volunteering_for/,ryan_770,879,Job Search,60,Top - all
Experience/Advice from a 10+ year data scientist,iorbjg,"For context, I was in most people's shoes here so this is why I want to give back some advice and inspiration. There's a bit of misinformation in this subreddit so I'll consolidate my thinking. DM me if you need specific advice

Background:

1. Been working in quant/data science for 10-11 years now. Didn't know where to go because this field didn't exist when I was in school.
2. Self-taught. This is where my imposter syndrome appears but little did anyone know this. Learned SQL through sqlzoo, learned R as a hobby to day-trade (yahoo-finance api, zoo package, etc.), Python through codeschool(?) or codeacademy(?) in 2012 (it was free back then), Math through OCW/torrented whitepapers & textbooks, ML through whitepapers & textbooks (coursera did not exist yet)
3. Interviewed around a lot and got rejected a lot (100+). When I first began, this was not a field, but the interview process & rejections gave me grit and understand what to study. I interviewed for a lot of exciting startups (now public companies) before they were even big. A small hedge fund gave me a chance as a quant trader, and our group got shut down in a year. I got a second chance somewhere else and the company went public (data science was central to their strategy)
4. Data Science is exciting. This field has brought me around the world. Worked at a hedge fund, electricity markets, global consulting, somehow ended up doing A.I work, and now in a strategy role. I don't oversee data scientists anymore, they mostly report to my business function now but previously managed 20+ data scientists.  Worked all over the globe and across many, many states. 

Advice:

1. Study and code everyday. Make it a habit. Blog posts, whitepapers, textbooks. I've lost this habit and I regret it -- getting back into it. You should love learning, otherwise you're in the wrong field.
2. Build up your foundations. Python/R, Probability/Stats/Calculus/LinAlg/DiffEq, Algorithms. This will help you understand a lot . Do take an algorithms & design course. Most problems are solved through a design approach / framework rather than a model.
3. Stay in touch with whats going on. hackernews/datatau/rweekly & understanding  new Data Engineering trends, Tech Engineering Blogs. Example, when I read some company blog about their implementation of spark in 2014, I immediately started playing around with it with my models.
4. Always be humble & prepare to get humbled but remain self-confident and determined. Don't be afraid.
5. Find a subject you like to get started. Loving data & modeling is one thing, but find an area that really interests you. For me, I started with time series (not for the faint of heart). This introduced me to a lot of difficult concepts.
6. Find a product/field. For me it was Energy & Finance. It can be marketing, sales, finance, pure ML, pure optimization work, supply chain, etc. Being a general hobbyist will only get you so far.

Lastly, Data science is not all SQL. It depends on how close you are to the revenue generating side. If you’re making a quarterly report on demand, that isn’t data science. If you’re building growth models to accelerate users on your platform that tie to scale and revenue. SQL will get your dad but still have to come up with model",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/iorbjg/experienceadvice_from_a_10_year_data_scientist/,misterpoolittle,872,Career,86,Top - all
"To the companies that send candidates a 3 hour take-home test, and then say their corporate policy does not permit feedback after one is rejected...",rsfdlx,"Your hiring process is terrible and you absolutely have a terrible policy.

Job hunting is already a crappy, long and unrewarding activity, and at the very least feedback would be helpful to help candidates improve their chances in their job hunt for the next role they apply to.

It's not only the 3 hour test that's stressful, but even before doing the test we have to review and refresh our knowledge because we've all been pigeonholed one way or another at our respective firms. It's a 3 hour test for you, but it's days/weeks of studying, interviewing, holding current job, juggling with shit on our end.

"I posted for a Data Analyst, this is what you are competing against",13k8665,"Our org needs a new data analyst, so I wrote up a job description with the skillset I needed and passed it off to our HR director to do what she needed and post it. I didn't put any degree requirement on it, I put responsibilities and real tools the new hire would be expected to work with. It is a remote role. I started looking for the posting, but couldn't find it, so I asked for a copy because my LinkedIn was getting attention indicating it existed somewhere.

I expected this response if I had posted for a Data Scientist role, but I didn't. I posted for a Data Analyst.

She took it down. There were 255 applicants in less than 24 hours. She sifted through half of them, excluded those who weren't already authorized to work in the US and those who didn't show English proficiency through their resume, and then forwarded me 9. I don't know that the 9 was all of the viable candidates that remained, they did seem to be biased to areas we have a footprint in the US, and I had just requested a sample.

Of those 9, 3 were absolutely new to the field. They put a data analytics certificate, but didn't even list which of the languages indicated on the posting they already knew. They didn't list any projects, just their previous work history (which was at best adjacent to the field). I looked up their certificates quickly and then moved on. List your technical skills - I'm not looking for ""good attitude, can learn"", I want to know how you've gotten yourself started in ways that are relevant to what I need. Your certificate only matters in what it taught you, not that you have it.

I had 4 that were on point. They had the skills I had listed and then a few, and they either had relevant work experience or a history of coursework (online or through universities) that showed they would have a good framework to start from.

Two were overqualified. Their experience was legitimately as data engineers. I assume they actually read the posting, so they remain in consideration, but their skills are beyond the specifics I need. I can't justify paying them more unless I can find ways that benefit the org to use those extra skills. I assume they will drop themselves from consideration when we talk more, so if I were in a time crunch, I would cut them from my list. Wishful thinking on getting a unicorn isn't a good use of my time.

I figured this was an opportunity for some perspective, seeing that we get ""what do I need to do to get a role"" posts all the time. I don't know what response I would have received if I had region locked this to around our HQ, or if we were offering hybrid or on-site work.

Just to add - I am not accepting resumes through here. I'm also ignoring anyone who finds my or my coworkers' LinkedIns and sends us resumes outside the standard process. I've already seen those happen.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I also considered projects in the ""on point"" group - they showed they applied the skills.

Update: I checked with HR, the pay was included in the post. To be clear, it was mid-3rd quartile  for a Data Analyst position - we weren't posting anything with an amazing rate. It's very possible people submitted without reading the details, especially given the skill mismatches I see. I feel better about it, because I could not have written a more honest description of the role, so they had full information.

Also, 27 resumes were forwarded to me so far. I have sent 10 back for follow up, with another 5 to be written up on my side.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/13k8665/i_posted_for_a_data_analyst_this_is_what_you_are/,greenearrow,866,Career,285,Top - all

I drove 3 hours to a random forrest and not a single tree gave me a decision. Every time I hit a server with a pickaxe it breaks.

I was kicked out of the Pirates of the Caribbean filming set because i demanded to know where the pacman machine was. I have 3 restraining orders by woman named Julia.

"I'm sick of ""AI Influencers"" - especially ones that parade around with a bunch of buzzwords they don't understand!",gfnax4,"This is going to come off as salty. I think it's meant to? This is a throwaway because I'm a fairly regular contributor with my main account.

I have a masters degree in statistics, have 12+ years of experience in statistical data analysis and 6+ in Machine Learning. I've built production machine learning models for 3 FAANG companies and have presented my work in various industry conferences. It's not to brag, but to tell you that I have actual industry experience. And despite all this, I wouldn't dare call myself an ""AI Practitioner, let alone ""AI Expert"".

I recently came across someone on LinkedIn through someone I follow and they claim they are the ""Forbes AI Innovator of the Year"" (if you know, you know). The only reference I find to this is an interview on a YouTube channel of a weird website that is handing out awards like ""AI Innovator of the Year"".

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords.

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?

"Against all stigma, I love being a SQL monkey!",11nwxd6," A year ago I landed a job at an F50 company thinking it was a data science position. I was a bit hesitant because I didn’t know what to expect and many people here made SQL monkeys look so bad. Most of my work involves writing queries and making dashboards, and right from the start people showed great appreciation for my work. Yes, I did mess up several times, but I was never scolded about it. Instead, I was nicely told how to deal with it. 

I have less than 2 years of experience out of college and I make just above 6 figures. I’m also expecting a 15-20% increase in the next year. I’m also doing a master's in data science at the same time to solidify my role in the industry and in case I decide I wanna switch to a more “data sciency” role. I have the opportunity to learn more about machine learning from different teams here and maybe eventually switch to one but I’m really happy with where I’m at at the moment, especially since it’s a very low-stress environment.

I applied to 250 jobs and timed how long each one took,17m8la5,"Applying to jobs online is like navigating a maze.

Amidst the special torture that is resume parsing software, the inability to reuse information across different application tracking systems (ATS), and the existence of a certain company that rhymes with every day of the week, it can get pretty frustrating.

I wanted to explore what factors make a job application more or less frustrating.

For example, what industries have the worst application processes? Do big companies ask for more information than small companies? What is it about websites like Workday that make them really hard to use?

To answer these questions, I applied to 250 jobs. One by one. Click by click. No Linkedin Easy Apply, no shortcuts – just straight from the careers page.

I timed how long it took me to go from “apply to job” to “submit application”.

Make no mistake: I sacrificed my soul for this post. I created over 83 accounts and spent a total of 11 hours scrolling. I was originally going to do this for 500 companies, but wanted to chop my head off halfway.

I did this for a mix of companies – Fortune 500 to early stage startups, spread out across different industries from software to manufacturing. The *type* of role I applied to was kept constant: engineering / product focused.

The outcome? An average of over two and a half minutes per application—162 seconds of your life you'll never get back. But as we dig deeper, you'll discover that these 162 seconds only scratch the surface of an often maddening process.

*Key Takeaways*

* **Average Application Time:** On average, it took a bit over two and a half minutes to apply to a job.
* **Company Size Impact:** If company size doubles, the application time increases by 5%. If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%.
* **Industry Influence:** Being a government company is the single largest determinant of a long application, followed closely by aerospace and consulting firms.
* **Longest Application:** The longest application time went to the United States Postal Service (10 minutes and 12 seconds).
* **Shortest Application:** On the other hand, It took me just 17 seconds to apply to Renaissance Technologies.
* **ATS Impact:** Older ATS like Workday and Taleo make job applications as much as 128% longer.

# The Setup

There’s no real method to the 250 companies I pick. I’m just typing names into Google and trying to vary it up. Where does Trisha work? What was that billboard I saw? It's all up for grabs.

Here’s the distribution of the 250 companies by size:

Some examples of companies in each range:

* 1-500 → Glean, Quizlet, Gumroad
* 500-5,000 → Notion, Dolby, Moloco
* 5,000-50,000 → Airbnb, Genentech, Logitech
* 50,000-100,000 → HP, American Express, Pfizer
* 100,000+ → Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, General Motors

And here’s a look at the different types of industries represented:

# What makes a job application so frustrating

Generally speaking, the more frustrating a job application, the longer it takes to complete.

The three main factors that might influence how long a job application is (as measured in my data):

1. **Company size** → I would expect bigger companies to ask more questions.
2. **The ATS that is being used** → I would expect clunkier, older ATS to make job applications longer.
3. **Company industry** → I would expect more “traditional” industries to ask more questions.

We’re going to model the relationship between the above three factors and the amount of time it takes to complete a job application. To do this, we’re going to use a technique called linear regression.

Regression is about the way two measurements change together. It can help us make predictions.

For example, if I add 10 employees to a company, how many seconds will that add to the company’s job application process?

Since we have other factors like ATS and Industry, we will also account for those. For now, though, let’s just focus on each factor one by one.

# Company Size

Let’s first plot the data as is:

https://preview.redd.it/sdvfivrzvyxb1.png?width=3276&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d9d55db8d0fef37d0365c523a0c1ba7e3e4199

Yes, I know, this isn’t the most useful graph. I’m going to spruce it up real quick, I promise.

The United States Postal Service has a job application that took over 10 minutes to complete. Navigating their portal felt like using Internet Explorer in 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/40iu1ni2wyxb1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7b65699a39f2e4e3c3abadf38875280a673a0d7

Netflix’s application was just 20 seconds - their only mandatory requirements are your resume and basic info.

https://preview.redd.it/sl4fums4wyxb1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c0c87299460bd22163f34db1040a56ea3893059

Apple took me 71 seconds, still pretty fast for a company that has over 270,000 employees (PWC, which has a similar number of employees, took me almost six times as long).

Okay, back to the chart. There are a couple of problems with it.

First, the data is not linear. This is a problem if we want to use linear regression.

Second, the company size scale is hard to interpret because of the many data points clumped together near zero (representing all the smaller companies).

We can resolve both these issues with the following insight:

There is a big difference between going from 10 to 100 employees and, say, 10,000 to 10,100 employees. The first represents major changes in company structure: you might actually hire a proper HR team, a bunch of recruiters, and build out your candidate experience. The second, though, is pretty much just business as usual - think of a multinational opening up a satellite office or a regular month of hiring.

Since we want to account for this, our data is better suited to a log scale than a linear scale. I will also transform our Y-axis, the application time, to a log scale because it helps normalize the data.

If we plot both our variables on a log-log scale, we get the below chart:

https://preview.redd.it/5l4po6d8wyxb1.png?width=4304&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3199197ea1b608fc39b8c3626ab994dc9d5eb5e

Better right? This is the same data as the last chart, but with different axes that fits the data better, we observe a linear relationship.

We have the usual suspects in the top right: Government organizations, professional services firms, and some of the tech industry dinosaurs.

The variance in application times across smaller companies, like startups, is interesting. For example, many of the startups with longer application times (e.g OpenAI, Posthog, Comma.AI) reference that they are looking for “exceptional” candidates on their careers page. (Note that OpenAI has changed its application since I last analyzed it - it’s now much faster, but when I went through they asked for a mini essay on why you’re exceptional).

One thing that I was expecting to see was competitors mirroring each other’s application times. This is most closely represented with the consulting firms like Deloitte, E&Y, KPMG, etc all clumped together. McKinsey and Bain, the two most prestigious consulting firms, have applications that take longer to complete.

This doesn’t necessarily seem to be the case with the FAANG companies.

We can also calculate the correlation coefficient for this graph. This is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The closer to 1 the value, the stronger the relationship.

For the above data, we get a correlation coefficient of 0.58, which is a moderate to strong association.

Note that on its own, this doesn't tell us anything about causation. But it does start to point us in some type of direction.

It's not rocket science: big companies ask for more stuff. Sometimes they ask for the last 4 digits of your SSN.

https://preview.redd.it/c7g5717bwyxb1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c776e46d45d179a6627ba3470fd4f89ca04204

Sometimes they even ask if you’d be okay going through a polygraph:

https://preview.redd.it/1q52rzldwyxb1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3b8921e055d38e04ee7395e9b982fa50c38f9df

An argument here is that if big companies didn’t have some sort of barriers in their application process, they’d get swarmed with applications.

Consider the fact that Google gets 3 million applications every year. Deloitte gets 2 million. Without some sort of initial friction in the application process, those numbers would be even higher. That friction almost serves as a reliable filter for interest.

If you’re an employer, you don’t really care about the people using a shotgun approach to apply. You want the candidates that have a real interest in the position. On the other hand, if you’re a candidate, the reality is such that the shotgun approach to apply is arguably the most efficient.

So we have this inherent tension between companies and candidates. Candidates want the most bang for their buck, companies don’t want thousands of irrelevant resumes.

And in the middle, we have the plethora of application tracking software that can often be quite old and clunky.

# ATS

Everytime I came face to face with a company that used Workday as their ATS, I died a bit inside. This is because Workday makes you:

1. create a new account every single time
2. redirects you away from the careers page

I defined a redirect as one when the job description is not listed on the same page as the first input box part of the application.

This isn’t a perfectly accurate measure, but it does allow us to differentiate between the modern ATS like Greenhouse and older ones like Workday.

With every ATS, I implicitly had some type of “how easy is this going to be” metric in my head.

We can try to represent this “how easy is this going to be” metric a bit more concretely using the matrix below.

https://preview.redd.it/bvpeu47iwyxb1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=818191eb4a0a5924c582f3ad7ec9539bc510f6fa

Ideally, you want the ATS to be in the bottom left corner. This creates an experience that is low friction and fast.

If we plot application time versus ATS, this is what we get:

https://preview.redd.it/pe9zyxmkwyxb1.png?width=3184&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df5c1118f9f0044e2154c8ae63816332ca42d67

The ATS that don’t make you create an account and don’t redirect you are tied to lower application times than the ones that do.

One possibility is that certain companies are more likely to use certain ATS. Big companies might use Workday for better compliance reporting. Same with the industry - maybe B2C software companies use the newer ATS on the market. These would be confounding variables, meaning that we may misinterpret a relationship between the ATS and the application time when in fact there isn’t one (and the real relationship is tied to the industry or size).

So to properly understand whether the ATS actually has an effect on application time, we need to control for our other variables. We’ll do this in the final section when we run a regression including all our variables.

One of the big frustrations surrounding different ATS is that when you upload your resume, you then need to retype out your experience in the boxes because the ATS resume parser did it incorrectly. For example, I went to UC Berkeley but sometimes got this:

https://preview.redd.it/ay21vccnwyxb1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=9862b0860c49c87a76b02218f8e4118134acfb89

The only resume parser that didn't seem abysmal was the one from Smart Recruiters. TikTok's resume parser also isn't bad.

Another frustrating experience is tied to inconsistency between the company I'm applying to and the ATS.

https://preview.redd.it/9xzq21vpwyxb1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=8432b293be4db0f58770760097df0117b53e667e

A company’s application process is often the first touchpoint you have with their brand. Startups competing for the best talent can't afford extra steps in their process. Apple and Facebook can.

Whilst the average time to complete a job application may only be 162 seconds, the fact that many ATS require steps like account creation and authentication can lead to application fatigue.

It’s not necessarily the explicit amount of time it takes, it’s the steps involved that drain you of energy and make you want to avoid applying to new jobs.

# Industry

Okay, so far we’ve looked at company size and the ATS as a loose indicator of what might make a job application frustrating. What about the company industry?

You would expect industries like banking or professional services to have longer application times, because getting those jobs revolves around having a bunch of credentials which they likely screen for (and ask you to submit) early on in the process.

On the other hand, internet startups I’d expect to be quick and fast. Let’s find out if this is true.

https://preview.redd.it/i7825ssvwyxb1.png?width=4012&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f51989a663cf7b8c664eacb983a9be0a8dbc80b

Hyped up industries like AI and Crypto have shorter application times. As expected, banks and consulting firms care about your GPA and ask you to submit it.

A government company has to basically verify your identity before they can even receive your application, so the process is entirely different and reflected in the submission time.

For many technology companies, the application process is almost like an extension of the company’s brand itself. For example, Plaid (an API first Fintech company), has a neat option where you can actually apply to the job via API:

Roblox, a gaming company, allows people to submit job applications from within their [games](https://gamerant.com/roblox-company-interview-job-applicants-in-game/).

We also notice differences between legacy companies and their newer competitors. If we compare legacy banks versus neobanks (like Monzo, Mercury, etc), the legacy players averaged around 250 seconds per job application whereas the neobanks averaged less than 60 seconds.

If you can’t compete on prestige, you need to find other ways. One of those ways can be through asking for less information upfront.

# Putting it together

Now that we've analyzed each variable - the company size, ATS, and the industry - to understand the separate relationship of each to application time, we can use linear regression to understand the *combined* relationships.

This will allow us to determine what factors actually have an impact on the job application time versus which ones might just have had one when we looked at them in isolation.

After some number crunching in R, I get the following results (I’ve only added the statistically significant factors – the ones with the “strongest evidence”):

https://preview.redd.it/g2pg1o11xyxb1.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=2efc92ad2cfa4aaf25297d23c228d0c7343729f9

Here’s how you can interpret some of the information above:

* When a job app is for a company that is within the Government industry, the submission time goes up by 366% (assuming the size and ATS are constant). For the aerospace industry, this is 249% (and so on).
* When a job app is for a company using the Workday ATS, the submission times goes up by 128% (assuming the size and industry are constant). For the Phenom ATS, this is 110% (and so on).
* Our only (statistically significant) metric which seems to make job applications faster is the Lever ATS (42% shorter).

Okay, now what about company size?

Well, first up: company size is indeed statistically significant. So there is an effect.

However, its effect is not as strong as most of our other variables. To be precise, here are some ways to interpret our company size coefficient:

* If company size doubles, the app size increases by 5%
* If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%

This is a smaller effect size compared to ATS or industry (a 20% increases in app time for a 10x large company is a qualitatively smaller effect size than e.g. a 100% increase in app time for Taleo ATS). So although company size is statistically significant, it is not as strong of a driver as ATS and industry of app time.

# Wrapping it up

Two and a half minutes might not be too long, but it can feel like an eternity when you’re forced to answer the same questions and upload the same documents. Over and over again.

Think about catching a flight. All you want is to get on the jet. Hawaii awaits.

But first: the security line. You have to take your shoes off. You get patted down and your bag gets searched. The gate numbers don’t make sense. And then at the end of it, your flight’s delayed. Congrats.

Applying to a job can feel similar. All you want to do is say aloha to the hiring manager, a real human being.

To even have the remote possibility of making that happen, you need to create an account and password, check your email, retype your entire resume, tell them the color of your skin, and explain why this company you’ve never heard of before is the greatest thing on Earth.

And for what? Most likely for the privilege of receiving an automated email about two weeks later rejecting you.

If we make it tiring and unappealing to look for new opportunities, then we prevent people from doing their best work.

But what would a world where applying took just a few seconds actually look like? Recruiters would get bombarded with resumes. It's possible to argue that job applications taking so long is a feature, not a bug. You get to filter for intent and narrow down your application pool.

Is it fair to shift the burden of screening unqualified candidates onto good candidates that now need to provide so much information? Shouldn’t that burden fall on the recruiter?

The truth is that applying to a job via the careers page is a bit of a rigged game. The odds are not in your favor.

Sometimes, though, all you need is to only be right once.

Some ideas to improve your LinkedIn profile,vzmcc2,"Hey everyone,

We're entering difficult economic times, so I thought I could share some of the tactics I've used to get more job opportunities my way by making my LinkedIn (LI) profile stand out.

I'm not an influencer on LI nor I have insider information about its talent search algorithm. This information comes from reading papers about LI's search algorithms, researching LI Recruiter, and a lot trial and error experimenting with my own profile.

Let me begin by setting the stage.

To find candidates, recruiters use a tool called LI Recruiter. It allows them to enter relevant search terms such as ""Data Scientist"" and define filters such as ""has worked at Google"" to look for candidates.

After a query is defined, LI Recruiter uses a ""talent search algorithm"" that works in two stages:

1. It searches the network and defines a set of a few thousand candidates who meet the recruiter's search criteria.
2. Then the candidates are ranked based on how well they fit the search term and how likely they are to respond.

That's it. If your goal is to get more job opportunities your way, then you need to figure out how to improve your chances of appearing in 1 and ranking higher in 2.

Luckily, LI has published research about its talent search algorithm. It's not hard to get an idea of what will help you stand out from the  competition. Based on my research and experience, here are some things that should help your profile stand-out:

1. **Use relevant keywords in your profile.** You won't appear in the results if you don't include terms in your profile that recruiters use when they search for candidates. Review the keywords used in Job descriptions of the positions you're interested in, and make sure you have those in your profile.
2. **Reply to recruiters.** People often don't reply to recruiters when they're not interested in the job  opportunity. But the algorithm prioritizes those who are likely to  respond over those who are not. Respond to recruiters, even if it's just  to say no!
3. **Grow your network.** The lightweight version of LI  Recruiter only lets recruiters reach out to candidates up to their  3rd-degree network. Having few connections decreases your chances of  getting contacted.
4. **Gain influence.** You rank higher if you create  engaging content, have many visitors to your profile, or receive  endorsements and recommendations. As a general rule, try to write useful  content periodically and ask for recommendations from relevant  connections.
5. **Make relevant connections.** Wanna work at X? Make meaningful connections from X and interact with the brand. When recruiters from X are looking for candidates, you will rank higher.
6. **Use a photo.** This is based on my personal experience. A photo, especially a ""good"" one, increases the likelihood that recruiters will contact you.

If you have any questions, shoot me a message. And just for reference, here's [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanjcastillo/).

Here are some images and highlights from the papers and research:

"Kaggle is very, very important",xgu9wg,"After a long job hunt, I joined a quantitative hedge fund as ML Engineer. [https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/xbj733/i\_got\_a\_job\_at\_a\_hedge\_fund\_as\_senior\_student/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/xbj733/i_got_a_job_at_a_hedge_fund_as_senior_student/)

Some Redditors asked me in private about the process. The interview process was competitive. One step of the process was a ML task, and the goal was to minimize the error metric. It was basically a single-player Kaggle competition. For most of the candidates, this was the hardest step of the recruitment process. Feature engineering and cross-validation were the two most important skills for the task. I did well due to my Kaggle knowledge, reading popular notebooks, and following ML practitioners on Kaggle/Github. For feature engineering and cross-validation, Kaggle is the best resource by far. Academic books and lectures are so outdated for these topics.

What I see in social media so often is underestimating Kaggle and other data science platforms. Of course in some domains, there are more important things than model accuracy. But in some domains, model accuracy is the ultimate goal. Financial domain goes into this cluster, you have to beat brilliant minds and domain experts, consistently. I've had academic research experience, beating benchmarks is similar to Kaggle competition approach. Of course, explainability, model simplicity, and other parameters are fundamental. I am not denying that. But I believe among Machine Learning professionals, Kaggle is still an underestimated platform, and this needs to be changed.

Edit: I think I was a little bit misunderstood. Kaggle is not just a competition platform. I've learned so many things from discussions, public notebooks. By saying Kaggle is important, I'm not suggesting grinding for the top %3 in the leaderboard. Reading winning solutions, discussions for possible data problems, EDA notebooks also really helps a junior data scientist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xgu9wg/kaggle_is_very_very_important/,bluesformetal,833,Job Search,138,Top - all
"Unpopular opinion: Tableau is slow, clunky, and slows people down who come from a coding background",vxuxhv,"I’m an intern and I’m tasked to build a dashboard in tableau. I absolutely despise tableau after using it for a few days. Want to make a calculated field based on some logic? Oh yeah you need to come up with some crazy excel formula. Want to drag and drop something in a dashboard? Sure, but have fun with the ugly formatting? Want to make a simple stacked bar chart? Have fun trying to get the appropriate dimensions correct BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN HAVE AN OPTION TO SELECT A BAR CHART.

I hate tableau with a passion. I come from and R, python background, and I guarantee I could build the same dashboard in streamlit within a few hours vs the horrible clicking and dragging I do in 2 days to make one graph. even ggplot is so much easier than stupid garbage tableau.

I just failed my first Google-interview this week and I feel a little embarassed and proud,ujurw5,"I just wanted to tell someone!

I'm embarassed that I did poorly in front of kind people that I thought were really cool. At the same time I'm proud that I've gotten to the point where a company like Google interviews me. Also very proud that I did the interview even if I felt I hadn't studied enough leetcode to pass, because I knew I'd feel a heavy dose of shame when I fumbled with algorithm-questions live. But I did it anyway, and I didn't die! And they were still very nice to me.

I just wanted to share. If you've failed interviews for positions you thought were really cool, don't worry you are still so valuable.

I wanted to put this out there in case someone is feeling embarassed/sad they flunked an interview.

Put my foot down and refused to go ahead with what would amount to almost 8 hours of interviews for a senior data scientist position.,1cjdhdz,"I initially was  going to have a quick call (20 minutes) with a recruiter that ended up taking almost 45 minutes where I feel I was grilled enough on my background, it wasn't just do you know, x,y and z? They delved much deeper, which is fine, I suppose it helps figuring out right away if the candidate has at least the specific knowledge before they try to test it. But after that the recruiter stated that the interview process was over several days, as they like to go quick:

 - 1.5 hours long interview with the HM
 - 1.5 hours long interview focusing on coding + general data science.
 - 1.5 hours long interview focusing on machine learning.
 - 1.5 hour long interview with the entire team, general aspect questions.
 - 1 hour long interview with the VP of data science.


So between the 7 hours and the initial 45 minutes, I am expected to miss the equivalent of an entire day of work, so they can ask me unclear questions or on issues unrelated to work.


I told the recruiter, I need to bow out and this is too much. It would feel like I insulted the entire lineage of the company after I said that. They started talking about how that's their process, and it is the same for all companies to require this sort of vetting. Which to be clear, there is no managing people, I am still an individual recruiter. I just told them that's unreasonable, and good luck finding a candidate.

Data Scientist = Web Master from the 90s,j1q5w2,"This is something I've been thinking for a while and feel needs to be said. The title ""data scientist"" now is what the title ""Web Master"" was back in the 90s. 

For those unfamiliar with a Web Master, this title was given to someone who did graphic design, front and back end web development and SEO - everything related to a website. This has now become several different jobs as it needs to be.  

Data science is going through the same thing. And we're finally starting to see it branch out into various disciplines. So when the often asked question, ""how do I become a data scientist"" comes up, you need to think about (or explore and discover) what part(s) you enjoy.

For me, it's applied data science. I have no interest in developing new algorithms, but love taking what has been developed and applying it to business applications. I frequently consult with machine learning experts and work with them to develop solutions into real world problems.  They work their ML magic and I implement it and deliver it to end users (remember, no one pays you to just do data science for data science sake, there's always a goal).

TLDR;
So in conclusion, data science isn't really a job, it's a job category. Find what interested you in that and that will greatly help you figure out what you need to learn and the path you should take.

Cheers!

So many bad masters,vceaxx,"In the last few weeks I have been interviewing candidates for a graduate DS role. When you look at the CVs (resumes for my American friends) they look great but once they come in and you start talking to the candidates you realise a number of things…
1. Basic lack of statistical comprehension, for example a candidate today did not understand why you would want to log transform a skewed distribution. In fact they didn’t know that you should often transform poorly distributed data. 
2. Many don’t understand the algorithms they are using, but they like them and think they are ‘interesting’. 
3. Coding skills are poor. Many have just been told on their courses to essentially copy and paste code.
4. Candidates liked to show they have done some deep learning to classify images or done a load of NLP. Great, but you’re applying for a position that is specifically focused on regression. 
5. A number of candidates, at least 70%, couldn’t explain CV, grid search. 
6. Advice - Feature engineering is probably worth looking up before going to an interview.

There were so many other elementary gaps in knowledge, and yet these candidates are doing masters at what are supposed to be some of the best universities in the world. The worst part is a that almost all candidates are scoring highly +80%. To say I was shocked at the level of understanding for students with supposedly high grades is an understatement. These universities, many Russell group (U.K.), are taking students for a ride. 

If you are considering a DS MSc, I think it’s worth pointing out that you can learn a lot more for a lot less money by doing an open masters or courses on udemy, edx etc. Even better find a DS book list and read a books like ‘introduction to statistical learning’. Don’t waste your money, it’s clear many universities have thrown these courses together to make money.

Note. These are just some examples, our top candidates did not do masters in DS. The had masters in other subjects or, in the case of the best candidate, didn’t have a masters but two years experience and some certificates. 

Note2. We were talking through the candidates own work, which they had selected to present. We don’t expect text book answers for for candidates to get all the questions right. Just to demonstrate foundational knowledge that they can build on in the role.

Thank you r/datascience & r/dataisbeautiful - you guys helped me get my dream job! ❤️,n10o03,"Context: I used to love working with technology. When I was younger I did computer science at school, worked at Apple at 17 & had work experience at Toshiba Research Europe. Everything was going great until I got my GCSE grades back and realised my coursework was terrible. It wasn’t my fault but rather the teacher had taught us the complete wrong thing to do and only 1 person managed to pass. He was fired but when it came to A Levels I didn’t end up picking computer science. As much as I wanted to, I was anxiety riddled as a teenager and I didn’t believe in myself to do it. I ended up going to university, dropping out because of severe depression & going into bookkeeping. Then lockdown happened. I had so much free time that I ended up doing programming for fun & I got Reddit to try and find fixes to syntax errors when I’m programming but Reddit recommended me this subreddit & data is beautiful and I would check it everyday just because I found it interesting & it was the perfect blend between number crunching and technology - leading me to learn Python & get better with excel.

Fast forward to a few days ago and I manage to get an interview with an amazing employer to work as a Junior Data Analyst. I was really worried because I didn’t know who or what the competition was but I did my best & I mentioned that I followed these pages on Reddit. Turns out they only interviewed one other person and I had the edge as I used Reddit & taught myself in my spare time showing huge enthusiasm!

My first technical interview experience(22+ interview questions),lqozmp,"Today, I had a 45mins technical interview with a media based company and I thought I'd share the questions with you all since so many people on this subreddit are looking for jobs. I hope it helps someone! :)

**Background:**

I currently work as a DS and I have 1.5 years of work ex in the data and analytics field. I was initially hired as a DA so my interview was based on SQL which was quite easy (i'm a CS undergrad). I later got promoted to a DS position so I hadn't faced any serious technical DS interviews until today.

**Technical Questions asked:**

1. How would you go about predicting hotel prices for a company like [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)? - I previously worked at a similar company as a business analyst and hence the question. I was able to answer this based on the work I had done there.
2. Let's say you have a categorical column with 500 categories. How would you tackle this? - I answered that we can use Catboost as it uses the catboost target encoder which would help convert the categorical values into numerical values rather than going for one hot encoding. He then mentioned that he wants to use linear regression so I said that we can use target encoding methods like James Stein encoder or Catboost encoder(preferred as it tackles target leakage). Was my answer right or is there some other way because he didn't seem 100% convinced with it?
3. How would you check the weight of each feature in a decision tree? - I said that we can look at the feature importance of each feature. He then asked if a feature importance of 100 means the feature's influence on the target is 100? To which I replied that you can see the SHAP values to understand the influence of a feature on the target but honestly I haven't researched enough on it to comment further.
4. Can I use K Means with categorical data? - You can use one hot encoding to convert categorical data to numerical but using K Means with Euclidian distance on binary columns does not make sense so I would use K Modes rather than K Means for categorical data
5. How do I choose the number of clusters for K Means? - use elbow method or silhouette score and I explained both the methods
6. Let's say I use silhouette analysis on a customer segmentation exercise and get K=30 as optimal number of clusters. I can't show 30 clusters to the business so what do I do now? - I said that generally for customer segmentation we would need business input as well so what is a practical number of segments according to the business? He replied 5-10 so I said that well out of the 5-10 clusters whichever has the highest silhouette score should be chosen. But I don't know if this is the right answer?
7. Difference b/w K Means and K modes? - I just said that for categorical data we use K Modes because finding the mode of a particular category is more accurate and makes more sense rather than converting the category to binary values and using a distance algo like K Means.
8. How would you perform customer segmentation on OTT platforms? - I panicked on this one honestly and said age, gender, nationality and probably genre of shows, do they watch shows completely, how long have they been a member on the OTT platform (Yes ik some of these don't make sense but like i said i PANCIKED)
9. Do you think the above mentioned factors are a good representative of the customer lifetime value? - Uhh no idea what customer life time value means so I just winged this one
10. Can you have more than one independent variable in ARIMA? - I answered yes cause I do vaguely remember coming across this but I am not 100% sure.
11. What is the difference b/w ARIMA and ARIMAX? - ARIMAX is ARIMA but also has exogenous variables which help identify surges like holidays.
12. Would you use ARIMA or Prophet for time series? - I read an article that says a properly tuned SARIMA would outperform Prophet so i answered the same
13. How would you tune ARIMA? - by finding the best parameter values for p,d,q
14. What are p,d,q in ARIMA? - (I forgot what they represent but I tried to answer from whatever I could recall ) p=no. of previous lags to consider, q= i forgot, d = difference(?)
15. What exactly is ""d""? - I said that it represents the seasonality pattern but I now realize that seasonality is in SARIMA and not ARIMA. (ugh)
16. Can you pass non - stationary data to ARIMA? - No, because the assumption of TS is that data is stationary with constant mean and variance as it will assume the same patterns for future values as well
17. How do we check if data is stationary? - By plotting it first but more accurate way is to use Dickey Fuller test to confirm it
18. How do I choose which 10 new hotels to onboard on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)? - I said that we can look at the number of bookings, location, accessibility( metro, bus), is it near a tourist spot, reviews, stars.
19. What if my model has recommended that all the 10 new hotels that we should onboard should be from the same area X? How do I add a constraint to fix this? - I don't even know what topic this question is from but I said maybe you can modify the cost function by adding a variable which will penalize the cost function based on the number of hotels it suggests that belong to the same area or maybe we can add constraints to the cost function
20. If I add constraints to the cost function then it becomes a non linear optimization problem so how would you use linear programming to solve it? - I had no idea lol
21. What is the difference b/w segmentation and clustering? - I answered that segmentation is a use case of clustering but apparently the interviewer said that clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm while segmentation is a supervised learning algorithm.
22. Have you created a data pipeline before? - Nope

"[UNHINGED RANT] It’s kind of annoying to see that, in general, most data-related spaces are flush with “how do I get a job” and comparatively little discussion around the actual topic",y6w5ab,"The `data \w+` gold rush has been a blessing and a curse, blessing in that many of us are getting filthy rich off it, curse in that many (frankly unskilled) people see the job market and think “wow I gotta get me a piece of that” and proceed to bombard every specialist board with mentorship requests and e-begging for a crumb of interview. 

Frankly I wouldn’t mind this if the people asking had done some cursory research beforehand and asked politely, but it seems like every jerkoff who’s caught a whiff of an Excel spreadsheet thinks they can land a FAANG job overnight and, instead of looking on Google for “how to data job pls to help” and seeing the ten trillion useless Medium articles made by the endless morons trying to resume pad and slip their jimmy into an Amazon L3 role that would tell them practically everything they need to know (even if by and large anything posted on Medium is worthless) they choose to pepper subs like /r/dataengineering, /r/dataanalysis, and this one with the same “how to data job please give me six figures” - it’s like asking /r/personalfinance “help how do I own a bank account” repeated for every hapless schmuck who’s been hiding their Benjamins in granny’s cookie tin for the last sixteen years of their childhood. 

Not even getting into the fact that doing basic research on the topic at hand is probably *the* fundamental skill for any data-*whatever* role, what’s even funnier is that I’d hazard a guess that most of us who *actually work in the industry* have better things to do during the day, so the people answering questions are probably majority kids trying to get their first data-whatever job - blind leading the blind all over again.

A data scientist got caught lying about their project work and past experience during interview today,1bj9cvc,"I was part of an interview panel for a staff data science role. The candidate had written a really impressive resume with lots of domain specific project work experience about creating and deploying cutting-edge ML products. They had even mentioned the ROI in millions of dollars. The candidate started talking endlessly about the ML models they had built, the cloud platforms they'd used to deploy, etc. But then, when other panelists dug in, the candidate could not answer some domain specific questions they had claimed extensive experience for. So it was just like any other interview.

One panelist wasn't convinced by the resume though. Turns out this panelist had been a consultant at the company where the candidate had worked previously, and had many acquaintances from there on LinkedIn as well. She texted one of them asking if the claims the candidate was making were true. According to this acquaintance, the candidate was not even part of the projects they'd mentioned on the resume, and the ROI numbers were all made up. Turns out the project team had once given a demo to the candidate's team on how to use their ML product.

When the panelist shared this information with others on the panel, the candidate was rejected and a feedback was sent to the HR saying the candidate had faked their work experience.

This isn't the first time I've come across people ""plagiarizing"" (for the lack of a better word) others' project works as their's during interview and in resumes. But this incident was wild. But do you think a deserving and more eligible candidate misses an opportunity everytime a fake resume lands at your desk? Should HR do a better job filtering resumes?

Edit 1: Some have asked if she knew the whole company. Obviously not, even though its not a big company. But the person she connected with knew about the project the candidate had mentioned in the resume. All she asked was whether the candidate was related to the project or not. Also, the candidate had already resigned from the company, signed NOC for background checks, and was a immediate joiner, which is one of the reasons why they were shortlisted by the HR. 

Edit 2: My field of work requires good amount of domain knowledge, at least at the Staff/Senior role, who're supposed to lead a team. It's still a gamble nevertheless, irrespective of who is hired, and most hiring managers know it pretty well. They just like to derisk as much as they can so that the team does not suffer. As I said the candidate's interview was just like any other interview except for the fact that they got caught. Had they not gone overboard with exxagerating their  experience, the situation would be much different.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bj9cvc/a_data_scientist_got_caught_lying_about_their/,OverratedDataScience,781,Discussion,337,Top - all

"Against the negativity here, I just received my $200k salary offer in just 2 years (even in this economy)",mimpre,"Few months ago, I wrote in this thread (with an older account) about how I think some Data Scientists are getting underpaid and negotiation is an important skill during interviews as much as ML frameworks. It was meant to be a message to uplift all of us into better career development.

But when I wrote that my first job as a Data Scientist was making $150k a year and that we can easily make $200k with upgraded skills, experience and right negotiation, people here laughed at me -- said that I was trolling and that kind of salary was insane. I told them this is the average in the Bay Area, but they said that even seniors don't make this kind of salary.

Well 2 years later, I have just secured a $200k salary, $170k in base and $30 in yearly bonus (not including RSU). This is for a Data Scientist in ML role at a company in SF (not well known, but a stable company). I eventually settled for another company with far less salary but far better stock potential. But still.

Given that I proved my initial point, I want to say few additional points of affirmation.

1. Don't undersell yourself. Know your value and worth and stick to it with confidence even in this terrible economy.
2. If you can impress the hiring manager and the senior management during interviews, they're more than happy to work with your professed worth (if not in salary, then in bonus, stocks, etc.). Otherwise, they will lowball you. This requires a refined skill in both communication and technical chops
3. Know how to play the political game during interview cycle. Master the negotiation tactics. Know how to bluff. Too many tech folks don't like to do this and think that they can keep their heads down and work hard, and their accomplishments will be naturally rewarded by some supernatural force. That's rarely the case. Data and Software folks are not immune to necessities of nuanced and skillful communication.

BTW, I don't have FANG-level experience. My first company 2 years ago was a mid-sized startup most people haven't heard of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mimpre/against_the_negativity_here_i_just_received_my/,None,764,Job Search,338,Top - all
Is anybody else here trying to actively push back against the data science hype?,ldvl72,"So I'd expected the hype to die off by now, but if anything it's getting worse. Are there any groups out there actively pushing back against the ridiculous hype?

I've worked as a data scientist for 5+ years now, and have recently been looking for a new position. I'm honestly shocked at how some of the interviewers seem to view a data science job as little more than an extended Kaggle competition.

A few days ago, during an interview, I was told ""We want to build a neural network"" - I've started really pushing back in interviews. My response was along the lines: you don't need a neural network, Jesus you don't have any infrastructure and your data is beyond shite (all said politely in a non-condescending way, just paraphrasing here!).

I went on to talk about the value they CAN get out of ML and how we could build up to NN. I laid out a road map: Let's identify what problems your business is trying to solve (hint might not even need ML), eventually scope and translate those business problems into ML projects, start identifying ways in which we can improve your data quality, start building up some infrastructure, and for the love of god start automating processes because clearly I will not be processing all your data by hand. Update: Some people seem to think I did this in a rude way: guys I was professional at all times. I'm paraphrasing with a little dramatic flair - don't take it verbatim.

To my surprise, people gloss over at this point. They really were not interested in hearing about how one would go about project managing large data science problems. Or hearing about my experience in DS project management. They just wanted to hear buss words and know whether I knew particular syntax. They were even more baffled when I told them I have to look up half the syntax, because I automate most of the low-level stuff - as I'm sure most of us do. There seems to be such a disconnect here. It just baffles me. Employers seem to have quite a warped view of day-to-day life as a data scientist.

So is anybody else here trying to push back against the data science hype at work etc? If so, how? And if many of us are doing this then why is the hype not dialling back?

Anyone else been mildly horrified once they dive into the company's data?,13o7m3d,"I'm a few months into my first job as a data analyst at a mobile gaming company. We make freemium games where users can play for awhile until they run out of coins/energy then have to wait varying amounts of time, like ""You're out of coins. Wait 10 minutes for new coins, or you can buy 100 coins now for $12.99.""

So I don't know what I was expecting, but the first time I saw how much money some people spend on these games I felt like I was going to throw up. Most people never make a purchase. But some people spend insane amounts of money. Like upsetting amounts of money.

There's one lady in Ohio who spent so much money that her purchases alone could pay for the salaries of our entire engineering department. And I guess they did?

There's no scenario in which it would make sense for her to spend that much money on a mobile game. Genuinely I'm like, the only way I would not feel bad for this lady is if she's using a stolen credit card and fucking around because it's not really her money.

Anyone else ever seen things like this while working as a data analyst?

\*Edit: Interesting that the comment section has both people saying-

1. Of course the numbers are that high; ""whales"" spend a lot of money on mobile games.
2. The numbers can't possibly be that high; it must be money laundering or pipeline failures.

How I went from no coding or machine learning experience to data scientist job offer in 20 months. [x-post r/learnprogramming],713hnw,"TL;DR: learned a buncha shit in 20 months with no prior anything-related experience, got job as data scientist

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Edit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn’t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master’s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don’t be afraid to switch jobs when you’re bored or it’s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they’re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn’t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn’t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it’s always good to mention how much data you’ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don’t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT’s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx’s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn’t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you’re leaning towards the development side.


&nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it’s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won’t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan’s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn’t too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla’s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It’s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn’t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It’s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn’t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford’s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it’s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don’t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they’d like to see my what I do on the side. I’ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I’m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesn’t have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you’ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because that’s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The rest…eh. Doesn’t really matter.


&nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- “junior data scientist”, “data scientist”, “senior analytics”, “senior data analyst”, “junior machine learning”, “entry data science”, and so on. When you’re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can’t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you’re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


I’ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn’t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


•	What tools I used at work 


•	How have I made processes more efficient at work


•	Anything I’ve automated 


•	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


•	Why the shift from the current job


•	How much I know about their company and how I’d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I’ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn’t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn’t feel complete. I couldn’t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn’t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I’ll go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code “worked”, there was likely some test cases I didn’t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn’t follow through.


&nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And you’ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you’ve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You’ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadn’t made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn’t prepare for questions they’d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I’d ask them. This did two things: I didn’t obsess about what they’d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they’d ask questions about how I’d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that’s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it’s a way of thinking you’d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you’ll know what you did inside out, so it’s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don’t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP of Data Science**

&nbsp;

•	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn’t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it’s what he was thinking too.

&nbsp;

•	*How’s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I’d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they’d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

&nbsp;

•	*What’s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people

&nbsp;

Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they’re working on, what’s the first thing I’d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Tech**

&nbsp;

•	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I’m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

&nbsp;

•	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn’t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

&nbsp;

•	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that’s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

&nbsp;

•	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I’d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

&nbsp;

•	*Cool man!*

&nbsp;

He probably liked that I wasn’t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**COO, President** 


•	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.

&nbsp;

•	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with “Nothing? Not even selling lemonade?”. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.

&nbsp;

•	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won’t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I’m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I’d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I’m all for that. I’m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the “finding meaning” part.

&nbsp;

•	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn’t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Data Scientists**


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**VP Marketing (first form)**


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 

&nbsp;

•	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn’t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.

&nbsp;

•	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.

&nbsp;

•	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.

&nbsp;

From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn’t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.

&nbsp;

**CMO** 

&nbsp;

•	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.

&nbsp;

•	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.

&nbsp;

•	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven’t experienced it before so I’d have to learn how to operate within that structure.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I’m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.

&nbsp;

•	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.

&nbsp;

•	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job

&nbsp;

•	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn’t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.

&nbsp;

•	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before

&nbsp;

•	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it’s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn’t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.

&nbsp;

After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Marketing (final form)**


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain’s gears go overdrive.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.

&nbsp;

•	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven’t done it in practice. Couldn’t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.

&nbsp;

•	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.

&nbsp;

•	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng’s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D

&nbsp;

•	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I’ve described here- that I felt useless after my master’s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.

&nbsp;

I asked him:


•	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


•	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


•	“You’ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I’d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.”


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn’t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like “peace!”


And that was that!


&nbsp;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. It’s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don’t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don’t let up!


&nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


I’ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I’m not a fan of this explanation but I’ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don’t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It’s uncomfortable, you’ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they’ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It’s business. It’s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you’ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I’ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:


http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And that’s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You don’t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It’s almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it won’t stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldn’t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they’re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you’re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	You’ll stumble through a lot of material- and that’s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You’ll reach the “aha!” moment when everything clicks and you “get it”. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, it’s hard to know where to start and where to go. I’ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you’re lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn’t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You’ll burn out sometimes, and that’s okay! If you’re as driven and passionate as I was, you’ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Quick start guide for data science:**


(in no particular order)


-	Introduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org


-	Either:


o	Andrew Ng’s Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)


o	Statistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)


-	Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy
Again, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A small rant - The quality of data analysts / scientists,14k6qt5,"I work for a mid size company as a manager and generally take a couple of interviews each week, I am frankly exasperated by the shockingly little knowledge even for folks who claim to have worked in the area for years and years.

&#x200B;

1. People would write stuff like LSTM , NN , XGBoost etc. on their resumes but have zero idea of what a linear regression is or what p-values represent. In the last 10-20 interviews I took, not a single one could answer why we use the value of 0.05 as a cut-off (Spoiler - I would accept literally any answer ranging from defending the 0.05 value to just saying that it's random.)
2.  Shocking logical skills, I tend to assume that people in this field would be at least somewhat competent in maths/logic, apparently not - close to half the interviewed folks can't tell me how many cubes of side 1 cm do I need to create one of side 5 cm.
3. Communication is exhausting - the words ""explain/describe **briefly**"" apparently doesn't mean shit - I must hear a story from their birth to the end of the universe if I accidently ask an open ended question.
4. Powerpoint creation / creating synergy between teams doing data work is not data science - please don't waste people's time if that's what you have worked on unless you are trying to switch career paths and are willing to start at the bottom.
5. Everyone claims that they know ""**advanced excel**"" , knowing how to open an excel sheet and apply =SUM(?:?) is not advanced excel - you better be aware of stuff like offset / lookups  / array formulas / user created functions / named ranges etc. if you claim to be advanced.
6. There's a massive problem of not understanding the ""**why?**"" about anything - why did you replace your missing values with the medians and not the mean? Why do you use the elbow method for detecting the amount of clusters? What does a scatter plot tell you (hint - In any real world data it doesn't tell you shit - I will fight anyone who claims otherwise.) - they know how to write the code for it, but have absolutely zero idea what's going on under the hood.

There are many other frustrating things out there but I just had to get this out quickly having done 5 interviews in the last 5 days and wasting 5 hours of my life that I will never get back.

A little advice after 15 years in this field as an industry practitioner and academic.,jvwgq3,"I noticed an inflow of people disappointed that the field is not what they thought it would be employment wise.

Correct me if I'm wrong but my overall feeling is that you are not reaping the rewards your masters/bootcamp/online course promised. You are not turning down people left and right asking for your services. And thus, you feel like the field is not what you wanted.

A bit of my background I started doing ""data science"" back in 2005, I have a Masters and a PhD on applied Machine Learning. I've done consulting in AI for NTT Japan (largest IT company in the country), done 2 postdocs in top 20 Universities, both of them on applied AI to Science. Consulting to the largest companies in LatAm, and currently on charge of 10+ ML/DataScience experts as ML Director as one of the Largest Banks in LatAm by assets.

* 1st Advice. If you are in it for the money, better invest wisely.

**If you have no experience**. Don't spend 400 usd in 400 little Udemy classes, or a Datacamp subscription, etc. Spend big and go to a big name school to do a Masters, there are plenty of funding options. Believe me, even if you learn the same thing, the fact that your certification/course says MIT instead of DataCamp is my only pointer if you don't have field experience at all. I say it again, this is **IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE.**

* 2nd Advice. Get all the experience you can, even if it's pro bono!

There is nothing like working with real datasets, I couldn't care less if you did all the tutorials on tensorflow or Sklearn using MNIST or Fashion MNIST, guess what, so did the other 40 applicants. But if you were privy to any datasets that few people can access, then I can see some value if your business understanding and capability of deploying ML techniques with data that no one else has seen before.

Sound hard? no, is extremely easy, the fact that there is a shortage of talent is no illusion. Go to a local University and look for researchers that might need to use ML in something, and offer to do that analysis, or only cleaning the data for free. That gives you both experience and opens doors for future employment.

The most interesting datasets I've seen have been in projects that I did for free or very little money.

* 3rd Advice. Learn the business and build yourself a niche.

Again, there is a need for DS and ML practitioners, that is very real, I have 3 open positions right now. But guess what? I won't hire anyone with no Finance or related experience. I need people capable of understanding business terms, and are capable of reading a Cash Flow and an Income Statement. Few applicants really know how to do it or have any interest in how to do it.

I have friend in the oil industry and is the same story all over again, people just want access to a dataset with no interest in learning about oil or extracting processes. 

&#x200B;

Note: Notice that all this advice is to give you all that extras and plus that you will need to get hired, doing a bootcamp or a course is not good enough anymore, you need to differentiate yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jvwgq3/a_little_advice_after_15_years_in_this_field_as/,leonoel,712,Career,163,Top - all

And I'm far from the only one with a similar experience.

Most ""data science"" problems don't require machine learning.

Yet, there is SO MUCH content out there making students believe that they need to focus heavily on building their Machine Learning skills.

When instead, they should focus more on building a strong foundation in statistics and probability (making inferences, designing experiments, etc..)

If you are passionate about building and tuning machine learning models and want to do that for a living, then become a Machine Learning Engineer (or AI Engineer)

We're data scientists planning a virtual career fair for other data pros during COVID-19. Looking for a job? Looking for help?,iwo0d4,"Hi there. This is Wojciech -- I'm a data scientist who has worked with IBM Research + McKinsey. I also ran an YC-backed AI company for 7 years where I've hired over 30 data scientists. My partner and I really want to help the data science community during COVID-19 and beyond.

Thanks to our networks, we've spoken with about a dozen companies looking to hire analysts or scientists... We know there are a lot of folks looking to get hired or start in this field...

**We're thinking of organizing a career fair with companies hiring for data science roles (analysts, data engineers, researchers) and those looking to fill them.** 

We're hoping it'll be particularly helpful or those who often get ghosted by recruiters (*not cool*), or those who apply for lots of jobs and feel like they're in a rut.

Would you be interested in participating? Please DM me and I'd love to learn more about you and get your feedback.

\~\~\~\~

EDIT: Hi everyone -- my direct messages aren't working anymore... Maybe too many coming in? [Here's a link to where you can sign up for the fair and we will follow up with you if you fill that out.](https://phaseai.typeform.com/to/zg5RDKpC)

Thank you!

Why are companies willing to spend so much on hiring new employees but on retaining them?,uo589a,"In April 2021, I got a 40% raise. That’s a pretty big raise.

But it didn’t make me feel very good. In fact, it made me realize that I had been leaving money on the table for almost two years.

I would never have got that raise unless I fought for it. Unless I typed the email and stuck my neck out, demanding what I was worth.

The experience taught me an important lesson:

Retention measures (like pay raises) are reactive, not proactive. If your company feels that you're happy there, they won’t pay you more.

In this post, I’m going to tell you that the data back this up, why this is the case, and what you can do about it.

*Before we start: if you like content related to growing your tech career, you might like* [*my newsletter*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe)*. It's my best content delivered to your inbox once every two weeks. Cheers :)*

**Salary compression**

Salary compression is what happens when companies don’t raise employees' salaries, but pay higher wages to attract new talent.

This imbalance between spending on new hires and existing workers has resulted in historic pay compression, with the gap between the wages of 20- to 24-year-olds (a reliable proxy for new hires) and 25- to 34-year-olds having shrunk to its smallest size in 36 years.

And this actually tends to impact the tech industry more so than others:

https://preview.redd.it/rmujs5im8zy81.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f5900a0d72001ae5fab8303e1ba9062c817369f

TLDR: employers are giving way more money to new hires compared to their existing employees.

This is pretty surprising considering the cost of replacing someone is high. Companies have to:

1. Absorb hiring costs
2. Search in a competitive market for talent
3. Distract team members for another round of interviews
4. Deal with onboarding costs and lack of productivity for first three months of new hire

So why does this happen?

Here are two possible reasons:

**Possible Reason #1: Retention efforts take time**

Solid retention efforts and policies are the type of initiatives that are hard to measure and work over a long period of time, like 5 to 10 years.

And those are often things that can’t be prioritized because of the hypergrowth nature of the tech industry. Investors want to see results now.

Some companies will spend a lot of time and effort to pay the least amount of money they can per role. They take pride in that. It’s much easier to just bring new people in.

Unfortunately, I don’t think it’s the right way to think about the world if you want to be a great company.

**Possible Reason #2: Their career ladder strategy isn't developed**

One of the most common things that happens, especially at high growth startups, is that your workload increases beyond the tasks of your original role, but your salary doesn’t change.

Defining these internal career growth ladders is actually quite time consuming. And so if it’s not been well defined, then there’s no real precedent for you to get a raise.

In these cases, it’s not even the case that the company doesn’t want to give you a raise, it’s just that they haven’t done the work to establish what the next step looks like.

**What this means for you**

First, you need to realize that salary is just one element of your total compensation package. There are a *lot of* factors you can negotiate with that are outside of your base compensation. A quick list:

* Remote work
* Number of holidays
* Professional development opportunities
* Health and wellness benefits
* Bonuses
* Stock options or other long term incentives
* Your hours
* Projects you get to work on

Second, I encourage you to keep in mind that [money isn’t everything](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/motivators-hygiene-factors). It’s pretty cliché but if you’re learning a ton, I don’t think you need to keep money at the forefront of your mind.

For example, at my last company, the first 12 months were great. I was learning something new everyday and my salary didn’t matter too much to me, because I was in “learning” mode.

The 6 months after that, though, were rough. When I stopped enjoying my work, all the focus became about my salary. And when I got the raise that I wanted, I realized that I was staying for the wrong reasons.

So if you think the raise is going to solve your job satisfaction problems, keep in mind that it probably won’t.

But you deserve to get paid what you’re worth. And if you’re not, it’s time to change that.

Here are three principles you should keep in mind when negotiating a raise:

**Principle #1: It's all about the evidence**

Identify your [top two accomplishments](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork) over the last 6-8 months. Pick ones that have a quantifiable impact. This is your ammunition.

Present this info however you want, but make it as easy as possible for your boss to vouch for you. Don’t make him do any unnecessary work - ideally, it should literally be him having to just forward the evidence you’ve presented (via a deck or a document) to his higher ups and then they discuss it.

Also have a clear salary number in mind. There’s plenty of ways to come up with a number - do research on sites like Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, H1BData, or maybe even reach out to others in the industry.

Once you have a clear number, bump it up by 15-20%.

**Principle #2: Keep your emotions out of it**

*“Anger is our friend. Not a nice friend. Not a gentle friend. But a very, very loyal friend… It will always tell us when we have betrayed ourselves.”* \- Julia Cameron, The Artist’s Way

Anger can be good. But it’s not in your best interests to be angry when negotiating.

Instead, you want to be firm and solution-oriented. That means that you’re not fighting against your boss or the company - you’re on the same team figuring out how you can do your best work.

For example, if you give a number and they come back with one that you’re unhappy with, instead of getting angry you can simply respond: “That doesn’t work for me. I’m curious how you arrived at that number. Can we walk through it?”

When you keep your emotions out of it, you’ll focus on how the promotion benefits **them** first and not you. And that’s what they want to hear.

**Principle #3: Timing matters**

If you have a performance review coming up in 3 months, don’t wait for 2.5 months to bring up your desire for a raise. Start early. Your boss will need time.

Two other tips:

1/ Try bringing this up after you’ve successfully completed a great project. Recency bias is real.

2/ If you’re purely trying to maximize your money, the way to do it is to get a competing offer and ask your current company to match it or go above. But you’ve got to be prepared to leave. High risk, high reward.

\*\*\*

One last thing.

No one is waking up every day thinking, “Is Shikhar happy in his job? Is he appreciated? Is he fairly compensated?”

I owe it to myself to advocate being paid fairly for my work.

As do you. So go make it happen.

EDIT: If you get the paywall, use the link below with similar details:

https://www.wired.com/story/zillow-ibuyer-real-estate/

This is a good lesson for data scientists. Zillow made a huge bet on their housing price prediction algorithm and lost billions in the process (at least 32 Billion in market cap).

Just because your algorithm predicts well in a test environment, doesn't mean other intangible factors can derail it in the real world. In this case, seller's feelings, housing layout, and local market conditions.

My question is, where was the pilot in this? This seems like executives got too eager to use this and pushed it out on a massive scale without getting enough feedback. Also, overall market conditions could have caused some bias here, rewarding poor decision making when prices were skyrocketing over the past year, and now that the market is more saturated, reality is setting in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qwqbxn/zillow_loses_billions_on_house_price_prediction/,DJAlaskaAndrew,707,Discussion,183,Top - all

Landed my first full time job today - Data Engineering,hipozj,"Hello everyone,

I have been browsing this and other related subs (r/cscareerquestionsEU, r/datascience, etc) for a long time now looking for advice on my journey to find a full-time job and our field in general. I graduated from my Master's program (major in ML, from a top tier university in Germany) this year in March and have been looking for full-time positions in the area for about 6 months now. Today I had a Zoom interview with a company (eCommerce) I had been in touch with for the past couple of weeks and about an hour ago, they called me saying they were really impressed and the job is basically mine if I want it. I am absolutely elated.

To give an idea about my job search process if it gives anyone a perspective being in a similar position, I applied for a total of 222 positions in the areas of Data Science, ML Engineering, Data Engineering, and a handful of Software Development positions as well (CV was same for every application and cover letter was modified a little bit depending on the company - in most cases, it was also the same. Perhaps that explains so many straight-up rejections).

**Ghosted:** 118.

**Outright rejections**: 68.

**Rejections after the technical stage**: 14.

**Still in the process** (applied less than 10 days ago and haven't heard): 22.

**Offers**: 2 (the other one is ML Engineer).

&#x200B;

I feel I am a little above average when it comes to programming but I do have a theoretical understanding of ML algorithms (master's helped), so that helped in some interviews. Regarding the choice between the offers, I feel I am gonna go with the Data Engineering one since there is a lot of room to learn new frameworks which I did not experience in academia (PySpark, Airflow, etc.), there is room to turn into a Data Scientist as the project continues and because the location is excellent.

There were a few days where I was really depressed about my rejections (especially when I got one or two emails in the morning) but I made myself resilient by thinking that the rejections don't matter much (especially the ones given without any interview) and kept on learning and applying. If you are in a similar position, keep on going. Things will turn for the better. :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to add a couple of things since this post is getting a bit of attention. I had a grade of 1.7/5 (in Europe/Germany, 1 is the best you can have and 4 is the worst; anything lower is failing) in my Master's. I had one and a half years of part-time working experience and I was a Teaching Assistant for two years for an ML/DL course in my program.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hipozj/landed_my_first_full_time_job_today_data/,TheStampTramp,698,Job Search,189,Top - all

"So many people disappointed with their jobs. You need to manage your expectations, especially if you're very junior.",gv3i57,"&#x200B;

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gv3i57/so_many_people_disappointed_with_their_jobs_you/,MonthyPythonista,686,Discussion,88,Top - all

(Hopefully almost) everything you need to know about data science interviews (EU perspective),syjt0c,"So I’ve recently dived into job search again. Hadn’t really interviewed a lot since more than 3 years and well yeah, the market has changed a lot. Have a total of 5 YoE + STEM PhD which means this experience is probably not generalisable, but I hope these insights will be helpful for some. Just wanted to give back because I benefitted a lot from previous posts and resources, and the Data Science hiring process is not standardised, which makes it harder to find good information about companies. In fact I'm sure that the hiring process is not even standardized inside big companies.

# On BigTech

I’d like to provide an overview over the steps of Big Tech companies that recruit for Data Scientist positions in the EU. I will copy this straight from my notes so all of these come from actual interviews. If there’s no salary info it means I didn’t get to discuss it with them because I dropped out of the process for whatever reason before I ended up signing my offer. In total I spoke with around 40 companies and ended up having 3 different offers, went to 6 final round interviews and stopped some processes because I found a great match in the meantime.

**Booking.com**

Salary: €95k + 15pct Bonus

Interviews:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hackerrank test (2 questions, 1 multiple choice, 1 exercise)
3. 2 Technical interviews:
   1. 20 minutes past projects, real case from Booking for solving it,
   2. Second interview: different case, same system
4. Behavorial interview

**Spotify**

Salary: €85-€90k + negotiable bonus

Process:

1. Recruiter call
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavorial but there was some exercise on Bayes’ Theorem that involved calculating some probabilities and using conditional + total probability.
3. Technical screening, coding exercise (Python / SQL). SQL was easy but they do ask Leetcode questions!
4. Presentation + Case Study (take home)
5. Modeling exercise
6. Stakeholder interview

**Facebook/Meta (Data Scientist - Product Analytics)**

I lost my notes but the process was very concise! Regardless of the product, their recruitment process was one of the most pleasant ones I’ve had. Also they have TONS of prep material. I think it went down like this:

1. Recruiter call
2. Technical screen SQL, but you can also use Python / pandas. Actually they said they’re flexible so you could probably even ask for doing it in R
3. Product interviews (onsite)

**Zalando**

I did not have any recruiter call, they just sent me an invitation for the tech screen and there would be only 2 steps involved

1. Technical screening with probability brainteaser (Think of dice throwing and expected value of a certain value after N iterations), explaining logistic regression „mathematically“, live coding (in my case implement TF-IDF) and a/b testing case
2. Onsite with 3-4 interviews

**Wolt**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Hiring manager interview, mostly behavioral
3. Take home assignment. This one is BIG, the deadline was 10 days and they wanted an EDA, training & fitting multiple ML models on a classification task, and then also doing a high level presentation for another case without any data
4. Discussion of the take home + technical questions
5. Stakeholder interview

**DoorDash**

1. Recruiter screen
2. Technical screen + Product case. Think of SQL questions in the technical but you can also use R or Python. They ask 4 questions in 30 mins so be quick! Product case is very generic.
3. Onsite interview with mostly product cases and behaviorals

**Delivery Hero**

1. Recruiter interview
2. Hiring manager interview
3. Codility test, SQL + Python

5. Stakeholder interview: largely behavioural
6. Bar raiser interview: this is Amazon style, live coding + technical questions

# Some other mentions:

**Amazon + Uber**

Sorry, they keep ghosting me :D

**Klarna**

Just a hint: they’re hiring as crazy for data science, I got contacted by them but the recruiter didn’t have any positions that would match my level so we didn’t proceed further. I was a bit sad about this because they’re growing, the product is hot and they may IPO soon.

**QuantCo**

Because I have some different 3rd party recruiter in my mailbox every week: They pay very well, I was told the range is up to 230k / y. 140k base + negotiable spread between bonus and equity. They’re not public so I wouldn’t want to sit on their equity. Anyway, I responded twice to that and got ghosted twice from different recruiters. I would recommend ignoring them.

**Revolut**

They contacted me but I decided to not pursue this further because of their horrible reputation and the way their CEO communicates in public.

**Wayfair**

I interviewed with a couple of people who have worked there before as head of something, no one was particularly excited. I applied there once for a senior data analyst position and they sent me an automated 4 hour long codility test. I opened it but decided to drop out of the process.

# On the general salary situation

For senior data science roles outside of big tech I think a reasonable range to end up at is €70k-90k. In big tech you can expect €80-100k base comp + 10-15% bonus / stocks. I’m sure there’s people who can do a lot better but for me this seemed to be my market value. There are some startups I didn’t want to mention here that can pay pretty well because they’re US backed (they acquire a lot recently), but usually their workload is also a lot higher, so it depends how much you value additional money vs WLB.

[levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) is very (!) accurate if the company is big enough for having data there. Should be the case for all big tech companies btw.

# On interview prep

There’s already great content out there!

While I don’t agree with everything here (like working on weekends and being so religious about the prep), I think the JPM top comment summed up how the prep should be done quite well: [https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Have-DS-interviews-gotten-harder-in-the-past-few-years-WbYfzXbE)

I also read this article many times: [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two\_months\_of\_virtual\_faangmula\_ds\_interviews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ox9h2j/two_months_of_virtual_faangmula_ds_interviews/)

I have to say that I started prepping way too late, basically while I was already knee deep into interviewing, but it worked out well anyway.

**SQL:**

Stratascratch is great if you want to practice for a specific company, but Leetcode will prep you more generally imo. I recommend getting a premium for both actually, even though it's expensive. I just took a one-time monthly subscription (be sure to cancel it immediately after booking it as they will just keep charging you).

**Which Leetcode questions to practice:** [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

I honestly didn’t see a lot of Leetcode style questions but they do sometimes ask about it and then you're happy if you recognize the question

**If you need to dive deep into probability theory:** [https://mathstat.slu.edu/\~speegle/\_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html#probabilitybasics). I honestly bombed all probability brainteasers I got asked. It can make you feel stupid but looking back at my undergrad material (which is a veeeeery long time ago) I realized that I was once upon a time able to answer these kinds of questions, I just don’t need them for work. Given that they’re rarely asked I wouldn’t focus on this too much honestly.

**For general machine learning & stats:**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D\_qZ5V&index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PLOg0ngHtcqbPTlZzRHA2ocQZqB1D_qZ5V&index=1) This video series was my bible. IMO it covers everything you’ll need in data science interviews about machine learning. Honestly, no-one ever asked me anything more complicated than logistic regression or how random forests work on a high level. For reading things up [I also can’t recommend the ISLR book enough](https://www.statlearning.com/)

**On product interviews:**[https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b](https://vimeo.com/385283671/ec3432147b) I watched this video by Facebook many times. I think if you use their techniques you’ll easily pass most product interviews.

# On recruiter calls

These are really easy imo, in the later stage I had an 80-90% success rate. I made a script for my intro and it took around 4-5 minutes to say everything. This is quite long also because I make sure I speak slowly and clearly when introducing myself, but the structure is the roughly like this:

1. Brief introduction on background + specializations (if you’re really, I mean REALLY good at ML modeling feel free to mention right in the beginning that this is how you’re perceived at work
2. Overview over your current department / team
3. What is your work mode (e.g. cross functional teams, embedded data scientist, data science team)
4. What kind of projects have you worked on
5. What is the scope of those projects (end-to-end, workshops, short projects). It also helps to give a ballpark of their usual timeframe
6. What are your responsibilities in those projects
7. What is your tech-stack / Alternatively: give examples throughout the projects of where you e.g. work with sklearn, pandas, …

I have made great experiences with that. Usually I apologise if I feel that I was going into too much detail or spoke too long, but so far everyone was fine with this and it is imo a great entry point for further discussions. I use this intro also for every other time I meet someone new.

# On hiring manager calls

These are imo quite easy, it’s usually more about the team fit and you shouldn’t have problems if you prepared with the Facebook material. Have some stories about projects ready as they usually ask you about at least 1 or 2 of them. Get familiar with answering questions in the STAR format.

I sometimes made the experience that they’re a bit pushy with their questions. If you feel that they’re focusing a lot on a specific project where you might feel that it’s not the most relevant for the role I recommend leading the direction politely away from there. I sometimes experienced that they were asking many questions about a rather simple model where I also didn’t do any ETL/database work. I recommend saying something in the way of „while surely an ARIMA model is useful, I would like to emphasise that we normally use it as a baseline because it’s easy to explain, but I do prefer increasing the complexity if the project allows for that, as I did for example in project Z. As this was one of my most impactful projects so far I’d love to elaborate on that as well if you’re okay with that, as I want to give you the best possible overview on my skillset and areas of interest.“ If they keep pushing about that not so relevant project I would consider it a red flag honestly and I had such cases before, even though they were very rare.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA)

Let me just leave these here.

# On take home assignments

I’ve done a few of them. I learned a lot from them. I hated every single one of them. I hated Leetcode even more in the beginning, but I’ve started to appreciate it, because take homes are just so arbitrary. As I had advanced talks with a couple companies, I skipped more and more of them. At some point I started telling companies that I don’t have time to do them due to other commitments and pending offers. The ones that were enthusiastic about hiring me moved me forward anyway. The ones where I didn’t leave a great impression told me it’s a requirement. So my advice is: If you’re willing to walk away from the process, decline them. It’s not respectful of our time. In one case I told a company that I can’t do it but I’m happy to explain how I’d approach it in detail in a call, otherwise I’d have to withdraw my application. The take home was very extensive, evaluate a large public dataset, do the EDA, fit some models, build an API, dockerize it and show you’ll make a prediction from the worker. They were a bit unorganised and scheduled a meeting about it, but the one evaluating it was super surprised that I didn’t prepare anything. We ended up coding a toy model and deploying it anyway and they forwarded me in the process anyway. Again, I would only recommend this if you’re willing to walk away from the offer, for me this was 50/50.

# On scheduling interviews

In general, bigger companies move slower, but I would suggest mass applying once you’re talking to a few of your favourites. I started practicing on unimportant roles about 1-2 months before I went hardcore with interviewing. I recommend not accepting any offers too early, the market is crazy right now! However, once you have an offer and you had at least a chat with the recruiter or better the hiring manager for a role, even big tech companies can move quickly! After my first offer I had many processes expedited and completed in 2-3 weeks.

# On anything else

Feel free to ask here. As this is a throwaway I won’t check my DM, but I will try to answer any publicly posted questions. Good luck everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/syjt0c/hopefully_almost_everything_you_need_to_know/,dscience_throwaway,674,Job Search,68,Top - all
Imposter syndrome and prioritizing what to learn,m71ijk,"Imposter syndrome comes up in this sub a lot, and as someone who feels like he has (mostly) learned to manage it, I wanted to share my experience with it - and what was ultimately my major breakthrough.

In a nutshell, there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome:

1. You are a generally competent person
2. There are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you *and that's ok and expected.* Even more importantly: you're not the smartest person in the planet, so if you look hard enough you're going to find people that are better than you at everything you do *and that's ok.*
3. You have a finite amount of time to learn things, and your goal shouldn't be to learn the most, but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals - generally, this is going to be career advancement, but for some it may be something else. 

In that order.

I think that, generally, imposter syndrome shows up in a thought cycle that goes the opposite direction. That is:

1. You don't have enough time to learn something you want to learn.
2. You look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don't have time to learn
3. You feel incompetent

So when you feel that, flip it: 

1. Remind yourself that you are a competent person - if you weren't, you wouldn't have gotten to the position you are in right now, whether that's graduating from college or leading a data science team (yes, even DS team leaders catch the 'drome from time to time).
2. Remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area, you are guaranteed to find them - that's just how it works. People choose to specialize in certain areas, and if you only focus on that area of expertise, you are going to feel inadequate. But even more importantly, recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do, that doesn't diminish your value - it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special\*
3. Get back to prioritizing what to learn. Do you *need* to learn that or do you just *want* to learn it to feel better about yourself? If the latter, learn to let it go, and focus on the things you need to learn - and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time, which will come.

\* As an anecdote - my first encounter with this scenario was a professor that literally did everything I liked doing - but better. He was a tenured professor at a top school, he had come \*this\* close to being a professional soccer player, and he was a classically trained musician, was in incredibly shape for his age and was a generally charming dude. I was a fumbling grad student who played recreational soccer poorly and played in a shitty metal band that no one ever went to see play, out of shape and generally a not-so-charming dude. 

It made me *incredibly* self-conscious for about a minute until I realized ""wait up... this guy is just an abject abnormality of humanity. I shouldn't feel bad about myself, I should just be impressed by how smart and accomplished this guy is *because 99.99999% of the population would be looking up at him too"".*

That helped me later in life when I would encounter people who I felt were just fundamentally smarter people than me. In particular, I remember hiring someone for my team that was so smart and thinking ""there is a better chance that I am going to be working for her in 10 years than the other way around"" *and being ok with that.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/m71ijk/imposter_syndrome_and_prioritizing_what_to_learn/,dfphd,668,,90,Top - all
R is far superior to Python for data manipulation.,ltkt9s,"I am a data scientist and have a pipeline that usually consists of SQL DB ->>> slide deck of insights. I have access to Python and R and I am equally skilled in both, but I always find myself falling back to the beautiful Tidyverse of dplyr, stringr, pipes and friends over pandas. The real game changer for me is the %>% pipe operator, it's wonderful to work with. I can do all preprocessing in one long chain without making a single variable, while in pandas I find myself swamped with df, df_no_nulls, df_no_nulls_norm etc. etc. (INB4 choose better variable names but you get my point). The best part about the chain is that it is completely debuggable as it's not nested. The group_by/summarise/mutate/filter grammar is really really good at it's job in comparison to pandas, particularly mutate. The only thing I wish R had that Python has is list comprehension, but there are a ton of things I wish pandas did better that R's Tidyverse does. 

Of course, all the good ML frameworks are written in Python that blows R out of the water further down the pipeline. 

I would love to hear your experience working with both tools for data manipulation.

"Pandas 2.0 is going live, and Apache Arrow will replace Numpy, and that's a great thing!",12dbhsg,"With Pandas 2.0, no existing code should break and everything will work as is. However, the primary update that is subtle is the use of Apache Arrow API vs. Numpy for managing and ingesting data (using methods like read\_csv, read\_sql, read\_parquet, etc). This new integration is hope to increase efficiency in terms of memory use and improving the usage of data types such string,  datatime, and categories.  


>Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc) are very slow and can't be used. So the data representation is not Python and is not standard, and an implementation needs to happen via Python extensions, usually implemented in C (also in C++, Rust and others). For many years, the main extension to represent arrays and perform operations on them in a fast way has been NumPy. And this is what pandas was initially built on.  
>  
>While NumPy has been good enough to make pandas the popular library it is, it was never built as a backend for dataframe libraries, and it has some important limitations.

**Summary of improvements include:**

* **Managing missing values:** By using Arrow, pandas is able to deal with missing values without having to implement its own version for each data type. Instead, the Apache Arrow in-memory data representation includes an equivalent representation as part of its specification
* **Speed:** Given an example of a dataframe with 2.5 million rows running in the author's laptop, running the `endswith` function is 31.6x fasters using Apache Arrow vs. Numpy (14.9ms vs. 471ms, respectively)
* **Interoperability:** Ingesting a data in one format and outputting it in a different format should not be challenging. For example, moving from SAS data to Latex, using Pandas <2.0 would require:
   * Load the data from SAS into a pandas dataframe
   * Export the dataframe to a parquet file
   * Load the parquet file from Polars
   * Make the transformations in Polars
   * Export the Polars dataframe into a second parquet file
   * Load the Parquet into pandas
   * Export the data to the final LATEX file  
However, with PyArrow, the operation can be as simple as such (after Polars bug fixes and using Pandas 2.0):

&#8203;

    loaded_pandas_data = pandas.read_sas(fname) 
    
    polars_data = polars.from_pandas(loaded_pandas_data) 
    # perform operations with pandas polars 
    
    to_export_pandas_data = polars.to_pandas(use_pyarrow_extension_array=True) to_export_pandas_data.to_latex()

* **Expanding Data Type Support:**

>Arrow types are broader and better when used outside of a numerical tool like NumPy. It has better support for dates and time, including types for date-only or time-only data, different precision (e.g. seconds, milliseconds, etc.), different sizes (32 bits, 63 bits, etc.). The boolean type in Arrow uses a single bit per value, consuming one eighth of memory. It also supports other types, like decimals, or binary data, as well as complex types (for example a column where each value is a list). There is [a table](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/arrays.html?highlight=arrowdtype#pyarrow) in the pandas documentation mapping Arrow to NumPy types.

Curious to see how an industry data scientist approaches a modeling problem? I'll be livestreaming a Kaggle problem this Thursday!,w2via6,"Hi! I am ar\_t\_e\_m\_is, a senior data scientist and member of this sub :) I did create a new profile for this, but I do have a main I'd be willing to share if someone would like to DM.

I am hoping to offer an opportunity for aspiring and junior data scientists or analytics professionals to see what data science and data analytics is all about, by doing a live-stream of a data science project :). It is very common in industry, especially non-tech, for stakeholders to ask for a ""proof of concept"" quickly. I'm going to build one live :)

On **Thursday July 21** around **830pm EDT**, I will be doing a livestream on Twitch with a dataset I have never analyzed, and working on a machine learning solution while live streaming :) I will analyze the dataset, prep it for a modeling problem, and try to build and optimize a model while also unlocking business-driven insights :) And, yes, this does include searching Stack Overflow and debugging along the way! During the stream, I will be talking about my career path, how I got to where I am at, and offering insight into the successes and failures of my career.

If you'd like to learn more about my background, I've included a redacted version of my resume. The link to the channel is in my profile, or I can include in this post so long as it doesn't break rule #3 for the sub!

Would LOVE to see you there, and will be very responsive with answering all questions about the process, my career, and the data science field in general.

If you have any questions, feel free to post below or DM!

I am tired of being assessed as a 'software engineer' in job interviews.,i3o4fe,"This is largely just a complaint post, but I am sure there are others here who feel the same way.

My job got Covid-19'd in March, and since then I have been back on the job search. The market is obviously at a low-point, and I get that, but what genuinely bothers me is that when I am applying for a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, or Machine Learning Engineering position, and am asked to fill out a timed online code assessment which was clearly meant for a typical software developer and not an analytics professional.

Yes, I use python for my job. That doesn't mean any test that employs python is a relevant assessment of my skills. It's a tool, and different jobs use different tools differently.

First Year As A Data Scientist Reflection,jpljoo,"It's wild to think it's been a year since I first became a data scientist, and I wanted to share some of the lessons I've learned so far.

**1. The Data Science Title Is Meaningless**

I still have no idea what a ""typical"" data scientist is, and many companies have no idea either. A data science role is very dependent on the company and the maturity of their data infrastructure. Instead of a title, focus on what business problems are present for a particular company and how your skillset in data can solve it. Want to build data products? Then chase those business problems! Interested in using deep learning? Find companies with the infrastructure and problems that warrant such methods. Chasing data problems instead of titles will put you in a better place.

**2. Ask More Questions Before Coding**

I've been burned a few times learning that most non-data people have no idea what data solution they need. Jumping straight into coding after getting a request will set you up for failure. Take a step back and ask probing questions for further clarification. Many times you will find that someone will ask for ""ABC"" but after further questions they actually need ""XYZ"". This skill of getting clarity and consensus among stakeholders, regarding data problems and solutions, is such an important facet of being an effective data scientist.

**3. Prototype to Build Buy In**

Start with a simple example, get feedback, implement feedback, then repeat. This process saves you time and makes your stakeholders feel heard/valued. For example, I recently had to create an algorithm to classify our product's users. Rather than jumping straight into python, I created a slide deck describing the algorithms logic visually and an excel spreadsheet of different use cases. I presented these prototypes to stakeholders and then implemented their feedback into the prototype. By the end of this process it was clear as to what I needed to code and the stakeholders understood what value my data solution would bring to them.

**4. Talk to Domain Experts**

You end up making A LOT of assumptions about the data. Talking to domain experts of your data subject and or product will help you make better assumptions. Go talk to Sales or Customer Success teams to learn about customer pain points. Talk to engineers to learn why certain product decisions were made. If it's a specific domain, talk to a subject matter expert to learn whether there is an important nuance about the data or if it's a data quality issue.

**5. Learn Software Engineering Best Practices**

Notebooks are awesome for experimenting and data exploration, but they can only take you so far. Learn how to build scripts for your data science workflow instead of just using notebooks. Take advantage of git to keep track of your code. Write unit tests to make sure your code is working as expected. Put effort into how you structure your code (e.g. functions, separate scripts, etc.). This will help you stand out as a data scientist, as well as make it way easier to put your data solutions into production.

There is probably more, but these are the topics top of mind for me right now! Would love to hear what other data scientist have learned as well!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jpljoo/first_year_as_a_data_scientist_reflection/,dope_as_soap,658,Career,43,Top - all

What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,gf9hrs,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. 

Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gf9hrs/what_makes_a_good_personal_project_from_the/,dfphd,650,,58,Top - all

Why the ability to concentrate is the most important skill in 2020,hecc72,"Many of us usually have at least one thing that we know we need to do. And if somehow we managed to sit down and do it from start to finish. Our life would be better because of it. The problem is that people put off that thing, they do anything under the sun to distract themselves.

Being a person who naturally gets distracted easily and was surely one of the worst procrastinators. I can confidently say it's never too late to make a change. Because if somehow even I managed to find little strategies and create little short cuts to become someone who can concentrate for long periods of time. Then you can too!

\#1 Why it's so important?

First of all, it's probably not a secret that getting sidetracked nowadays is easier than ever. We are constantly bombarded with ads and online marketing. In fact, according to research, it takes around 15-20 min. to get back to your 100% concentration after getting distracted. Basically, if we cut to the chase - this new distracting digital age creates a huge demand for people who can resist distraction and concentrate.

2#The bar is so lower than you think

If you can dive in even for one hour on your most important thing for the day with a ruthless and intense focus. You will make substantial progress in your life. And as you get used to that hour of concentration. You can upgrade that to 2 or 3 hours. Just think how much intense focus that is. You will skyrocket past your goals!

3# Guilt-free pleasure and balance

I know that many of us want to have a balanced life. We want to achieve something or do something meaningful but still enjoy life. For example, maybe you want to work on your personal projects, but at the same time, you don't want to give up video games. This was one of the biggest pains I struggled myself. I would play a lot of video games but then at the same time I would feel guilty for not making progress on my personal goals. And it's funny because the solution is so simple. You can play the crap out of those video games after you put a tremendous amount of focus on something else. This way you don't feel guilty and can fully immerse yourself into video games.

And if the perks of mastering concentration don't entice you, you can stop here...

But if it interests you, consider reaching out to me - I'd be happy to answer all of your questions!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hecc72/why_the_ability_to_concentrate_is_the_most/,Karlos224,653,Career,107,Top - all

It's not just you. Everyone hates the return to office,16vaaco,"Somehow, I am lucky enough to land a completely remote role, 100% virtual because the rest of my team is virtual based but I still have to go into the office at least 12 times a year for bogus meetings to sit in a conference room while we all use WebEx, totally immersive right? But we have frequent meetings with other people in our field, data scientists, engineers, architects, etc. They are all back in office 4 days a week, and each of them has this ashy tone, they grudgingly hate being in the office, despise it, because who wants to go to a stuffy office?


Here are the top complaints that I have noticed from people about being in office

- The commute is terrible. Some people have to commute as much as 50 minutes one way, and that's not including traffic. That's crazy. You're not getting paid for that. That's free labor and travel for your company


- The office is incredibly distracting. Cubicles are typically open, so people can freely walk up and talk to you, make eye contact with you which starts a conversation, but you're still under the same time crunch you were when you worked from home completely isolated in your nice office away from everyone else


- ""Collaborative spaces"" and ""focus areas"" are bullsh*t. So many nice little desks, nooks, rooms for you to go to to focus or meet with others. But here's the thing, you never see anyone using those because I guess where they are? At their desk, working, constantly. No one ever has the time to use them. My office is so incredibly nice, and every time I walk around, I feel like I'm the only one taking a walk because I see everyone glued to their desks

- You're distracted constantly by others who are at different levels than you. The only way I figured out that there is some college intern making twice as much as I am doing a little bit more than me is by speaking to people in the immediate vicinity of my desk. Machine learning engineer versus data scientist. The difference? They use a little bit more power platform, a couple more tools, 20 more lines of Python a day. Congrats, here is 40K more for you. This can be very distracting, because you see these people all the time


- NO PRODUCTIVITY OR OTHER GAIN. Literally no benefit or gain from being back in the office. Just disgruntled people


- office supplies are shit. At home, I have an ultra wide monitor that I also use for personal PC gaming so I can just literally KVM switch it over. I have a modded gaming mouse and keyboard, a $200 Logitech pro headset with superior sound quality and microphone. You know what I don't have at the office? Any of this stuff. Yeah. A $5 Logitech mouse and keyboard that is extremely noisy and uncomfortable has no ergonomics at all. Office chairs are not ergonomic They are just the cheapest they could get. Uncomfortable $0.90 headsets and webcams


- MANDATORY extracurricular events and activities in or outside of work. Yes, this is real. After hours socials, restaurants, social outings. These are disguised as optional, but you will often get bullied teased or pressured into them. This also does not grant you any leeway during any project, you still have to get all work and projects done with this loss of time",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16vaaco/its_not_just_you_everyone_hates_the_return_to/,databro92,648,Discussion,257,Top - all

Warning to would be master’s graduates in “data science”,17798wz,"I teach data science at a university (going anonymous for obvious reasons). I won't mention the institution name or location, though I think this is something typical across all non-prestigious universities. Basically, master's courses in data science, especially those of 1 year and marketed to international students, are a scam. 

Essentially, because there is pressure to pass all the students, we cannot give any material that is too challenging. I don't want to put challenging material in the course because I want them to fail--I put it because challenge is how students **grow** and **learn**. Aside from being a data analyst, being even an entry-level data scientist requires being good at a lot of things, and knowing the material deeply, not just superficially. Likewise, data engineers have to be good software engineers.

But apparently, asking the students to implement a trivial function in Python is too much. Just working with high-level libraries won't be enough to get my students a job in the field. OK, maybe you don’t have to implement algorithms from scratch, but you have to at least wrangle data. The theoretical content is OK, but the practical element is far from sufficient.

It is my belief that only one of my students, a software developer, will go on to get a high-paying job in the data field. Some might become data analysts (which pays thousands less), and likely a few will never get into a data career.

Universities write all sorts of crap in their marketing spiel that bears no resemblance to reality. And students, nor parents, don’t know any better, because how many people are actually qualified to judge whether a DS curriculum is good? Nor is it enough to see the topics, you have to see the *assignments*. If a DS course doesn’t have at least one serious course in statistics, any SQL, and doesn’t make you solve real programming problems, it's no good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17798wz/warning_to_would_be_masters_graduates_in_data/,anon_throwaway09557,641,Discussion,313,Top - all

After reading this book, you will know the basics of supervised learning, understand complex mathematical models, understand the entire pipeline of a typical ML project, and also be able to share your knowledge with colleagues from related industries and with technical professionals.

And for those who find the theoretical part not enough - I supplemented the book with a repository on **GitHub**, which has Python implementation of every method and algorithm that I describe in each chapter.

Keep a Brag Document,h96nz8,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think “Where did all that time go?”

Even worse, if YOU can’t remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They’ll notice all the hard work you’re putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you’ve written.

But we don’t live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan’s blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you’ve achieved.

And these “wins” don’t need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That’s definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don’t want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn’t actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let’s say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There’s a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you’re just stuck somewhere you don’t want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You’ll often find that they’re able to mention things you completely forgot or didn’t even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn’t mean it’s easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other’s wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you’re basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you’re good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You’ll both be able to identify areas in which you’re doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that’s helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think “Wait..what was the point again?”

By using your brag document to set goals, you’ll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you’ll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

Advice for those entering the workforce: your job is not to be right - and it's certainly not to prove others wrong,edgai0,"Thinking back to my days as a first year data scientist, one of the most difficult transitions I've seen people make is how they measure their value.

Because academia is primarily an environment in which you're measured by how right or wrong you are, a lot of people transition into the workplace thinking the same. What's worse, some go further and extend that to the point of thinking that there is value in proving others wrong.

That is fundamentally not going to work. And that is because people in the workplace are measured almost exclusively on how productive they are - they are measured on results.

Corollary 1: if it's wrong but it works, then it's not wrong.

Corollary 2: if you're right but it doesn't change the outcome, then it doesn't matter.

Corollary 3: if you're right, but it doesn't work, then you're wrong. 

Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn't, then they're right and you're wrong. 

Corollary 5: if you prove someone's solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better. 

I cannot emphasize how much you can limit your career by focusing on right vs. wrong. Right vs. wrong is irrelevant; productivity always rules.

EDIT: Since many have had an issue with the definition of something that works vs. something that is wrong:

This is the part that people miss - it is rare that bad science works.

When things that a person sees as ""wrong science"" work, I normally find that the overwhelming majority of the time, if that person is junior, what is actually happening is that:

 1. It's not actually wrong, and the person just doesn't understand why it's right.

 2. It's not 100% right, but it's right enough to provide value. And some people interpret that to mean wrong, which is too binary in the world of modeling. 95% right isn't wrong, it's just 95% right. 

The only scenario where you will see bad science work with any degree of frequency is when it has been tested over too limited a set of scenarios - in which case it should be relatively easy to point out where it will fail, and then you can focus on outputs - on how it won't work, rather than on it being wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/edgai0/advice_for_those_entering_the_workforce_your_job/,dfphd,622,,91,Top - all

The Data Science Trap: A Rebuttal,vtzw0b,"More often than not, I see comments on this thread suggesting the dilution of the Data Science discipline into a glorified Data Analyst position. Maybe my 10 years in the Data Science field leads me to possessing a level of naivety, but I’ve concluded that Data Science in its academic interpretation is far from its practicality in application. 

Take for example the rise of VC funding of startups and compare the ROI/success rate of AI-specific startups versus non-AI centric companies. Most AI startups in the past 5 years have failed. Why is this? Overwhelmingly, there is over promise of results with underperformance in value. That simply cannot be blamed on faulty hiring managers. 

Now shift to large market cap institutions. AI and Machine Learning provide value added in specific situations, but not with the prevalence that would support the volume of Data Science positions advertising classic AI/ML…the infrastructure simply doesn’t exist. Instead, entry level Data Scientists enter the workforce expecting relatively clean datasets/sources with proper governance and pedigree when reality slaps them in the face after finding out Fred down the hall has 5 terabytes in a set of disparate hard drives under his desk. (Obviously this is hyperbole but I wouldn’t put it past some users here saying ‘oh shit how do you know Fred?!’) 

These early career individuals who become underwhelmed with industry are not to blame either. Academic institutions have raced ass first toward the cash cow of offering Data Scientist majors and certificates. Such courses are often taught by many professors whose last time in a for-profit firm was during the days where COBAL was a preferred language of choice.  Sure most can reach the topics of AI/ML but can they teach its application in an industry ill-prepared for it?

This leads me to my final word of advice for whomever is seeking it. Regardless of your title (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, etc), find value in providing value. If you spend 5 months converting a 97.8% accurate model into 99.99% accuracy and net $10K in savings but the intern down the hall netted $10M in savings by simply running a simple regression model after digging into Fred’s desk, who provided more value added?

Those who provide value will be paid the magnitude their contribution necessitates. 

Anyways, be great.

A harsh truth about data science....,1arg0lv,"Broadly speaking, the job of a data scientist is to use data to understand things, create value, and inform business decisions. It it *not necessarily* to implement and utilize advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. That's not to say that you can't or won't use ML/AI to inform business decisions, what I'm saying is that it's not always required to. Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.

I think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away. They apply them anywhere they can, kind of shoehorning them in and not having a clear idea of what it is they are even trying to accomplish in the first place. In other words, the tools lead the problem. Of course, the way it should be is that the problem leads the tools. I'm coming to find for like 50+% of the things I'm asked to do, a time series visualization, contingency tables, and histograms are sufficient to answer the question to the satisfaction of the business leaders. That's it. We're done, on to the next one. Start simple, if the simple techniques don't answer the question, then move on to the more advanced stuff. I speak from experience, of course.

In my opinion, understanding when to use simple tools vs when to break out the big guns is way harder then figuring out how to use the big guns. Even harder still is taking your findings and translating them into actual, actionable insights that a business can use. Okay, so you built a multi-layer CNN that models customer behavior? That's great, but what does the business do with it? For example, can you use it to identify customers who might buy more product with more advertising? Can you put a list of those customers on the CEO's desk? Could a simple regression model have done the same in 1/4 of the time? These are skills that take years to learn and so it's totally understandable for newer or prospective DSs to not have them. But they do not seem to be emphasized in a lot of degree programs or MOOCs. It seems to me like they just hand you a dataset and tell you what to do with it. It's great that you can use the tools they tell you to on it, but you're missing out on the identifying which tools to even use part in the first place.

Just my 2c.

6 months as a Data Science freelancer,17tit0r,"I have been a freelance Data Scientist for 6 month and I have more job offers than I can manage (I turn down offers every week). 

Some people have written me to get some tips on how to start and get some clients. 
So these are a few things I tried to find clients on Upwork, LinkedIn and in online communities.

1) Look for projects on Upwork. 
Set up a nice profile, showcase your project portfolio, research the market, bid on several projects and be willing to set a cheap rate at the beginning. 
You won't make much money the first month, but you will get exposure, your Upwork rating will improve and you can start to bid on some higher paying jobs. 
In 6 months my rate went up 4 times, so don't think it takes so long to get to a good hourly rate. 

2) Improve and polish your LinkedIn profile. 
Many recruiters will write you here. 
Insert the right keywords on your profile, document your previous work, post something work related every week, if you can. 
This is a long game but pays off because instead of bidding for jobs, in the end the recruiters will start to write you.

3) Join online communities of entrepreneurs.
There are several small businesses that look for Data experts and beyond. They have projects ongoing and want to hire freelancers for a short time. 
You can meet them in these communities. Look for them on Twitter, Discord, Slack, Reddit...
Engage with them, share what you do and soon you will start to get some interest. This type of interaction quickly turns into job opportunities.

4) Write. 
Just create a blog and post regularly. Post about what you do, the tools you have used and so on. Better to post a tutorial, a new tech you tried out, a small model you developed. 
All the successful people I know have this habit. They write and share what they do regularly.

5) Put yourself out there and interact online. 
Maybe one day you share something and it gets retweeted, maybe you pick up a good SEO keyword in your blog, you never know. That's why it's important to increase your exposure. You will increase your chances of getting noticed and potentially land a new client.

6) Be generous 
Once you do the above soon you will be noticed and people will start to contact you. 
They will not offer you a contract. That's not how it works. after all, they don't know you and they don't trust you. But something you wrote hit them. Probably they will ask for your help and advice on a specific issue. 
Give advice on the tech to use, how to solve a problem, how to improve their processes, give as much as you can, be honest and open. Say all you know and you will build trust. 
It's the start of a professional relationship.

7) Be patient
Not all conversations will turn into a job opportunity. Sometimes they lead nowhere, sometimes there is no budget, sometimes it takes months to sign a contract. In my experience maybe 2-3 out of 10 conversations turn into a job offer. 
Accept it. It's normal.

Resume observation from a hiring manager,pf9j9s,"Largely aiming at those starting out in the field here who have been working through a MOOC. 

My (non-finance) company is currently hiring for a role and over 20% of the resumes we've received have a stock market project with a claim of being over 95% accurate at predicting the price of a given stock. On looking at the GitHub code for the projects, every single one of these projects has not accounted for look-ahead bias and simply train/test split 80/20 - allowing the model to train on future data. A majority of theses resumes have references to MOOCs, FreeCodeCamp being a frequent one. 

I don't know if this stock market project is a MOOC module somewhere, but it's a really bad one and we've rejected all the resumes that have it since time-series modelling is critical to what we do. So if you have this project, please either don't put it on your resume, or if you really want a stock project, make sure to at least split your data on a date and holdout the later sample (this will almost certainly tank your model results if you originally had 95% accuracy).",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/pf9j9s/resume_observation_from_a_hiring_manager/,hybridvoices,582,Discussion,204,Top - all
LinkedIn / Blind / This sub is not real life,mm7w8r,"Not sure if this is relevant, but seeing so many posts about people feeling like they aren't good enough / smart enough / successful enough / \_\_\_\_\_ enough because they see others on LinkedIn / Blind / Twitter or even reddit posting about their sky high compensation and amazing accomplishments.

Keep in mind that the folks who post on these forums are not a representative sample. It naturally skews towards people who are drawn to high compensation / level / ""prestige""

Even sources like [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) only show the compensations of people who choose to share it, which again isn't a representative sample. If compensation / level / prestige is what you're after, by all means, go for it and work for it. But comparing yourself to people who  *humble brag* on social media does nothing good for your mental health. [Studies](https://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/) have shown that Instagram is bad for teens' mental health, comparing yourself to the humble braggers on LinkedIn/ Blind / other CS / DS focused social media would likely have a similar impact on your mental health too.

Also keep in mind that on average \~65,000 CS graduates graduate every year in the US. If you include China, India, and Russia the number is more like 460,000 graduates per year, of which \~45,000 are considered elite. My source is this [research article](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/14/6732). Assuming a 15% annual growth rate , that means \~3.5 million CS graduates just in the last 10 years,  (5.5 million in the last 20 years).

Of these, only about 10% (just napkin math based on number of employees in Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and assuming only \~50% of them are ""tech"" roles) can ever work in Big N, and of the 10% there, only about another 10% make it to Staff levels, which is where you see compensations of 500k+ (some seniors can make it too, but it's more reliably available at staff+ levels). And these salaries too are only common in SF Bay Area, Seattle, NYC, and maybe Austin. 

So you're comparing against 1% of an industry that is already on average better paid than most other industries.

I started out as an in-house data scientist and then moved on to management consulting. Here are 10 tips that have helped me greatly in business.,xqmj9q,"I started out as an in-house data scientist and then moved on to data science management consulting. This is where I learned very important soft skills that made me a way better data scientist.

Note: clients in this case can be anyone that gives you an assignment. For example, your manager, an external client, your colleague, etc.

## 10 tips:

1.	**Be helpful, don’t be obedient**. Help your client in the best way possible, but set boundaries on what you will do. Some people see us as these magical creatures that can do everything. Protect yourself from that.
2.	**Small talk is not a waste of time**; it is a social lubricant that increases the client’s confidence in you.
3.	**Adjust your message to the audience.** Check who they are and what is important to them. Also, make sure you use the right terminology (e.g. do not use technical terms when talking to non-technical business people).
4.	**A good presentation is like a good conversation**. Make your point, but also leave room for questions.
5.	**If you do not know the client beforehand, start with an introduction.** Who are you? What is your background? What are your hobbies?
6.	**Nobody likes surprises**. If something unexpected comes up, discuss this with your client as soon as possible.
7.	**Make the client feel that the solution was his or her idea**. Explain all the available options and guide the client to the preferred solution. This depends on what you're working on of course. For example, if you are not sure what data to include, try to involve your client and come up with an answer together.
8.	**The client is not your friend**. Be friendly, but watch what you say about your private life.
9.	The more senior your audience is, **the more to the point you need to be**.
10. Being professional is not about removing emotion. **It is OK to smile** :).

Unpopular Opinion: Data Scientists and Analysts should have at least some kind of non-quantitative background,ub045v,"I see a lot of complaining here about data scientists that don't have enough knowledge or experience in statistics, and I'm not disagreeing with that.

But I do feel strongly that Data Scientists and Analysts are infinitely more effective if they have experience in a non math-related field, as well.

I have a background in Marketing and now work in Data Science, and I can see such a huge difference between people who share my background and those who don't. The math guys tend to only care about numbers. They tell you if a number is up or down or high or low and they just stop there -- and if the stakeholder says the model doesn't match their gut, they just roll their eyes and call them ignorant. The people with a varied background make sure their model churns out something an Executive can read, understand, and make decisions off of, and they have an infinitely better understanding of what is and isn't helpful for their stakeholders.

Not saying math and stats aren't important, but there's something to be said for those qualitative backgrounds, too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ub045v/unpopular_opinion_data_scientists_and_analysts/,takenorinvalid,575,Discussion,156,Top - all
Job hunt update.,1c6p6m4,"I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/s/5MjMTDtBYB) after getting an offer a couple months ago. A couple weeks after the offer, it was rescinded. Probably for the best as I realized the original description did not match the actual role.

After the offer was rescinded, I took a couple weeks off the job hunt before getting back at it. Cleaned up the resume, started being more selective with where I applied, and grinding SQL problems online. About a month in I was interviewing with 3 companies. 

I don't feel like making another Sankey, but it's pretty much identical to the last, except I got 3 first round interviews, rather than the 1 last time. Companies are 1 mid-sized tech and 2 pre-IPO unicorns. I was ghosted by one unicorn after a screening round and am still interviewing with the other after 2 rounds, though after 5 rounds with the mid-sized tech I accepted a DS manager position.

My advice: 1) stop following this subreddit, it's 90% doom posting and 10% circle jerk. It doesn't feel like anyone here is actually interested in data science beyond getting a job. 2) mass send an easy to parse resume everywhere. 3) keep your head up, it's a grind. Don't forget to exercise, eat well, and have a social outlet. 4) referrals aren't worth what they once were. None of my dozen or so referrals resulted in even a screening interview 

I was rejected for roles I thought I was a shoo-in for and interviewed for roles I thought were a reach. There's a lot of luck (preparation+opportunity) involved that's often out of your control.

Good luck

I made my very first python library! It converts reddit posts to text format for feeding to LLM's!,1bxmy77,"Hello everyone, I've been programming for about 4 years now and this is my first ever library that I created!

## What My Project Does

It's called Reddit2Text, and it converts a reddit post (and all its comments) into a single, clean, easy to copy/paste string.

I often like to ask ChatGPT about reddit posts, but copying all the relevant information among a large amount of comments is difficult/impossible. I searched for a tool or library that would help me do this and was astonished to find no such thing! I took it into my own hands and decided to make it myself.

## Target Audience

This project is useable in its current state, and always looking for more feedback/features from the community!

## Comparison

There are no other similar alternatives AFAIK

Here is the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/NFeruch/reddit2text](https://github.com/NFeruch/reddit2text)

It's also available to download through pip/pypi :D

Some basic features:

1. Gathers the authors, upvotes, and text for the OP and every single comment
2. Specify the max depth for how many comments you want
3. Change the delimiter for the comment nesting

Here is an example truncated output: [https://pastebin.com/mmHFJtcc](https://pastebin.com/mmHFJtcc)

Under the hood, I relied heavily on the PRAW library (python reddit api wrapper) to do the actual interfacing with the Reddit API. I took it a step further though, by combining all these moving parts and raw outputs into something that's easily useable and very simple.

Could you see yourself using something like this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bxmy77/i_made_my_very_first_python_library_it_converts/,NFeruch,568,Projects,72,Top - all

Lying on the CV taken to the next level,zlobg8,"I have someone in my team who is currently applying for one of the internal roles - a promotion 2 levels above her current level.

This person has no technical skills, no understanding behind even simple concepts, just memorized a few things but is very interested in promotions and started asking about them 6 months into the role. Seems way more interested in promotions than learning DS :(

Anyway, I have seen plenty of people add about 20% to their CV, overstate their role in a project etc. This person has claimed that she has built 2 models that don't exist as a part of my team. She described techniques used and claims she has led the whole effort and the models are now deployed (these are techniques that I mentioned in team meetings, but always said that it will depend on the data. Turns out we didn't have enough good data so looks like these models will never be built. She is up to date on these developments). I am in a very large org and nobody really keeps track of new models etc.

On the basis of these lies, I have seen that she was invited for an interview. Many people that are way more talented but were more honest didn't. This really bothers me. I did mention it to my manager who seems disinterested and made a comment that I need to be building up junior DS and not tearing them down :(

Cheat Code for breaking into any field,rm6f7i,"A lot of people are trying to get into data science related fields and frequently ask similar questions along the lines of ""what do I need to know"" or ""I'm doing XYZ, does that make sense?""

That's a backwards way to think about it.

The way to do it is to look up a few dozen job postings for the role you want. From those postings, narrow it down to only the jobs you're interested in (data science is such a wide and non-standardized field that not all postings are applicable to you).

With the postings you're left with, identify which skills are common to most of those posts. Of those skills, some you will already have, so play them up in the experience of your resume. The ones that you don't have are ones that you should go learn.

This is a personalized process because of the breadth of the field, nobody in the world has expertise in the laundry list of skills people claim you need in medium or towardsdatascience articles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rm6f7i/cheat_code_for_breaking_into_any_field/,HesaconGhost,561,Discussion,97,Top - all

Name & Shame: Carlyle Group Investment Data Science,1bnmif0,"I think we're due for a name & shame! Sharing my experience in case it's helpful for future applicants.

# Company & Role

The Carlyle Group is a Private Equity mega-fund. They essentially buy and flip companies like a real estate investor buys and flips houses. They've recently (in the past few years) spun up a data science org. My understanding is that the responsibilities of this role would entail assisting the deal team in commercial due diligences of prospective investments, assisting in portfolio operations and consulting on advanced analytics for the portfolio companies, as well as company wide data science initiatives. My impression was that this role would not be very involved in deal sourcing.

# My Background

* FAANG Senior DS
* Worked in management consulting in the past - primarily as a data science consultant for Silicon Valley tech companies but also did a commercial due diligence project with our M&A practice as a DS consultant
* Ivy League masters in CS / Top 20 undergrad

# Application Process & Experience

* I first cold applied online
* After a short period of time I received an email from a Carlyle recruiter with a link to a 2 hour Hackerrank exam. I did not first receive any introductory call or even an introductory email - just an email with a URL to Hackerrank.
* I decided to take the exam. It consisted of:
   * One SQL (medium / window functions)
   * One Python (leetcode easy)
   * Discrete probability (e.g. probability of making a full house if you randomly draw 5 cards from a standard deck)
   * Domain specific data science questions (e.g. how would you apply data science to this private equity problem)
   * Overall I felt comfortable with all aspects of the exam and felt that it was well within my wheelhouse
* After completing the exam I sent a note to the recruiter. They scheduled a call with the ""senior recruiter"" for end of week
* The call with senior recruiter was fairly standard and covered the nature of the team, responsibilities of the role, and my background. I thought the call went well and was under the impression that I'd be moving forward in the process  (though I've learned never to take what recruiters say at face value)
* At the end of the call the senior recruiter asked if I had taken the Hackerrank exam yet. I was a bit surprised that they did not already know the answer to that question.
* After exactly one week of radio silence since the initial call, I emailed the first recruiter to let them know that I had seen some progress in my other searches (true) and asked if my application was still in consideration. I did not receive a response to this email.
* I waited one more week (two weeks since the initial call and about three weeks since I took the exam) and emailed the senior recruiter for a status update. I didn't receive a response to this email either but will edit this post if they ever do respond.

# Conclusion

* At this point I've concluded that I've been ghosted. I can only speculate as to why. I'm leaning towards them just being highly disorganized.
* For future applicants I strongly, strongly advise not taking their HackerRank exam unless you don't mind having your time wasted. I'm willing to bet nobody at Carlyle even looked at my test responses.

\*\*EDIT\*\*

It seems a lot of you think that ghosting is professionally acceptable. If you're investing your time, the bare minimum is a courtesy email to let you know you won't be moving forward in the process. That's actually table stakes.

"R, I love you.",o7c0z7,"Hi all,

I just wanted to make this post to simply share my experience (and also get your perspective/input) using different coding languages, namely python and R, to perform data analysis. I am by no means any expert; just a simple user who is completely in awe with this field.

I have only recently started to code in R (2 months now) and ever since, I cannot help but love it. I only started learn to code since last year and like many, I started off with python because the ML project I was working on last year required me to learn this language.

Since then, I moved to a different lab and the folks there really wanted me to use R to develop the code for data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis, regression analyses, etc..., since it is the most commonly used language in this field (Enviro. Chem).

While I was initially resistant at first to learn R, once I got the hang of it, it really started to feel like magic to me. What took me maybe 3 to 5 lines of code in python to perform a task (granted, I am not the best coder) is a simple function in R. Somehow, it all just intuitively makes sense to me.

I don't know; I don't find R getting much love out there (at least in my learning experience of data science), and just wanted to make a post about it. I aim to get much better in this language (and also python too), simply because I find this to be a very powerful language.

I guess that concludes my love letter to R.

The Secret sauce to landing a data science role,d9a3o1,"I see tons of posts on here claiming specific technical skills needed to become a data scientist. As someone who conducts interviews, mentors new data scientists, and up-skills analysts and engineers, I wanted to offer my perspective. While I believe it is true that there are certain base technical skills required, I do not believe technical knowledge is what your interviewer is looking for, especially if you've made it to a conversational interview. 

The skills listed are merely talking points. Your interviewer most likely understands that you aren't currently an expert at every skill they question. They are likely interviewing you until they get to skills you are unfamiliar with. How do you respond when you don't know something? Do you admit it, or do you try and cover your competency? Are you defensive or are you curious? This is a continuous learning and feedback role. How have you identified, learned, and implemented a new skill? Are you even passionate about learning or are you obviously chasing titles, prestige, or salary?

They are looking for you to be confident in what you do and do not know. Do you boast algorithms and techniques you can't explain or worse, are you arrogant or elitist? Quickly in this role you will be presented with extremely ambiguous requirements. How comfortable are you with this ambiguity and how can you adapt or learn what is necessary to overcome and move forward with development? Will the team risk failure because you didn't speak up about your ability? Do you seek perfection and risk analysis paralysis, or do you iterate and experiment quickly? Are you someone who is a joy to mentor, support, and watch grow? Grit, growth oriented, self-aware, and an open-mind are qualities I consider essential. 

With the right mindset and support, the technical skills are not difficult to learn, especially with the pace of evolving tools. It's an investment the company should be knowingly willing too make. This mindset is what is hard to train for.

"Any other data scientists out there, who do not care about doing data science stuff in their free time, or keeping up with the most cutting edge tech?",v9of4r,"I just can’t be bothered to do that stuff in my free time. I love my job, but it’s still a job. When I’m not working, the last thing I want to do is do more “work.” Unless it’s about something im really passionate about and I was just curious. But for the most part, I actively try not to.

I also don’t care about staying up to date with the most recent tech. Unless it will absolutely help me at my job, or rather, prevent me from climbing up the ranks, I don’t care at all.

I feel like its becoming an expectation that if you’re in data science, you must be passionate about data science. Which means you must do personal projects in your free time, and explore the latest technology. And I feel like that’s a bullshit expectation. I mean if you that’s what you do and enjoy it, by all means keep going. But that shouldn’t be the norm.

"Has anyone ""inherited"" a pipeline/code/model that was so poorly written they wanted to quit their job?",uhirub,"I'm working on picking up a machine learning pipeline that someone else has written. Here's a summary of what I'm dealing with:

* Pipeline is ~50 Python scripts, split across two computers. The pipeline requires bouncing back and forth between both computers (part GPU, part CPU; this can eventually be fixed). 
* There is no automation - each script was previously being invoked by individual commands.
* There is no organization. The script names are things like ""step_1_b_run_before"" ""step_1_preprocess_a"".
* There is no versioning, and there are different versions in multiple users' shared directories.
* The pipeline relies on about 60 dependencies, with no `requirements` files. Dependencies are split between pypi, conda, and individual githubs. Some dependencies need to be old versions (from 2016, for example).
* The scripts dump their output files in whatever directory they are run in, flooding the working directory with intermediate files and outputs.
* Some python scripts are run to generate bash files, which then need to be run to execute other python scripts. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine.
* Lots of commented out code; no comments or documentation
* The person who wrote this is a terrible coder. Anti-patterns galore, code smell (an understatement), copy/pasted segments, etc.
* There are no tests written. At some points, the pipeline errors out and/or generates empty files. I've managed to work around this by disabling certain parts of the pipeline.
* The person who wrote all this has left, and anyone who as run it previously does not really want to help
* I can't even begin to verify the accuracy of any of the results since I'm overwhelmed by simply trying to get it to run as intended

So the gist is that this company does not do code review of any sort, and the consequence is that some pipelines are pristine, and some do not function at all. My boss says ""don't spend too much time on it"" -- i.e. he seems to be telling me he wants results, but doesn't want to deal with the mountain of technical debt that has accrued in this project.

Anyway, I have NO idea what to do here. Obviously management doesn't care about maintainability in the slightest, but I just started this job and don't want to leave the wrong impression or go right back to the job market if I can avoid it.

my DS experience at Amazon,10ivzyj,"My 2.5 year stint at Amazon ended this week and I wanted to write about my experience there, primarily as a personal reflection but also sharing hoping it might be an interesting read here.. also curious to hear few other experiences in other companies.

i came up with 5 points that I found were generally interesting looking back or where I learned something useful.

1. Working with non-technical stakeholders- about 70% of my interactions was with product/program teams. remember feeling overwhelmed in those initial onboarding 1:1s while being bombarded with acronyms and product jargon. it took me 2 months to get up to speed.  one of the things you learn quickly is understanding their goal helps you do your job better.  
My first project was comparing the user experience for a new product that was under development to replace a legacy product, and the product team wanted to confirm that certain key metrics did favor the new product and reflect it’s intended benefits. Given my new-hire energy/naivete, I did lots of in-depth research (even bought Pearl’s causal inference book), spent weekends reading/thinking about it and finally drafted a publication-quality document detailing causal graphs, mediation modeling, hypothesis tests etc etc…. On the day, I go into the meeting expecting an invigorating discussion of my analysis.. only to see the PMs gloss over all that detail and move straight to discussing what the delta-metric meant for them. my action item from that meeting was to draft a 1-pager with key findings to distribute among leadership. I clearly remember my reaction after that meeting- *that was it?*

2. Leadership principles - Granted this is my first tech experience, but I always presumed a company’s marketing material is sufficiently decoupled from its daily operations to the point where the vision/mission/culture code doesn’t actually propagate to your desk. but leadership principles at amazon are genuinely used as guide-markers for daily decision making. I would encounter an LP being the basis of a doc section, meeting discussion or piece of employee feedback almost every week. One benefit for example, is the template it provides for evaluating candidates after job interviews.

3. Writing is greatly valued practice at Amazon, and considered a forcing function for clarity of thought. I saw the benefits from writing my own docs but more so in reading other people’s docs. its also way more efficient by allowing multiple threads of comments/feedback to happen in parallel during the reading session vs a QnA session with a few people hogging all the time. On a related note, i wondered on multiple occasions how senior execs enjoy their work given all they do is read docs all day with super-human efficiency (not that they read the whole doc of-course but still..).

4. self-marketing and finding good projects - this was one of those vague truths that nobody will tell you but everyone slowly realizes esp in big companies, or atleast was true in my case. Every person needs to look after their own career progression by finding good projects, surround themselves with the right people (starting with manager) and of-course deliver the actual work. it might be easy to only focus on 3 believing 1 and 2 are out of control but i feel they’re equally important. example- one of my active contribution areas was for a product that, somewhere along the way, got pushed to a sister org, but I was wedged deep into the inner-workings that they had me continue working on it throughout my time. At the time, I felt important to be irreplaceable but what it really meant was that this work was not aligned with MY org's goals. doh! guess which org’s metrics will mean more to your perf review panel come the end of the year.

5. more projects are self-initiated than i realized. piggy-backing on the previous point about good projects- there is lesser well-thought-through strategy around you than it seems but also more opportunity to find the projects that interest you with potential for outsized impact. example- my most impactful project was a self-initiated one launched to production with a definitively large impact on the product metrics... and it didn't begin as an ‘over-the-line’ item (i.e. planned in the quarterly planning cycle) with a dedicated PM, roadmaps etc. it was just me finding an inefficiency and building a solution and even got it published in an internal conference. this may not be ideal but shows its possible to find areas for impact.   
I also know of at-least 2 other self-initiated projects that evolved to be core to the org’s efforts. This aligns with why companies hold hackathons, google has its 20%-time allowance etc. it also makes you wonder, how much of the OKR, OP, 3YAP etc are actually driving innovation vs designed to create an artificial sense of planning. (jargon expansion- objective key results, operational planning, 3 year action plan)

that's it. for me, this was a rewarding experience and grateful for the people I got to work with. I hope some of this useful to some of you folks, especially to junior data scientists, or an interesting read at the least.

Hot take: Kaggle for entry level CVs is very mid-2010s. Here's what I'd do instead.,zby4e4,"Kaggle can be fun, but don't do it because you think it'll land you a job---that strategy has peaked and the noise is too high. People don't want to know you can apply some canned ML to a canned problem, and the frontiers of ML research is deep into AI at this point, to the point where it's just straight up a different career. What'd I suggest instead is practice asking questions and finding answers, which for this purpose should be as eye catching as possible. 

Download some city data and make a hilariously detailed plan for how to get good parking. Good can mean the cheapest or you can really have fun and try to optimize getting free parking at the risk of getting fined. Really learn about the domain, like be able to explain why it looks different on weekends because they allow alternate side parking or something. Bonus points for driving to the city and trying it out for real. Explain why your model's oversimplified.

This is just an example. IMHO it gets more to the heart of what data science really is today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zby4e4/hot_take_kaggle_for_entry_level_cvs_is_very/,apoplexiglass,533,Job Search,53,Top - all
Working with data scientists that are...lacking statistical skill,szluwh,"Do many of you work with folks that are billed as data scientists that can't...like...do much statistical analysis?

Where I work, I have some folks that report to me. I think they are great at what they do (I'm clearly biased).

I also work with teams that have 'data scientists' that don't have the foggiest clue about how to interpret any of the models they create, don't understand what models to pick, and seem to just beat their code against the data until a 'good' value comes out.

They talk about how their accuracies are great but their models don't outperform a constant model by 1 point (the datasets can be very unbalanced). This is a literal example. I've seen it more than once.

I can't seem to get some teams to grasp that confusion matrices are important - having more false negatives than true positives can be bad in a high stakes model. It's not always, to be fair, but in certain models it certainly can be.

And then they race to get it into production and pat themselves on the back for how much money they are going to save the firm and present to a bunch of non-technical folks who think that analytics is amazing.

"Why you're ""bored"" at your job (and how to fix it)",mhh5zu,"This is a post especially relevant for those of you transitioning into data science from a non-traditional background - so I hope you find it especially helpful :)

In the 1950s, Frederick Herzberg developed a theory that states there are two dimensions to job satisfaction: motivation and hygiene. 

Hygiene factors can minimize dissatisfaction at work, but they can’t make you love your job. These are factors like salary, supervision, and working conditions.

When you look back at the best moments of your career, they won’t really include the perks or the free lunches you got.

Instead, you’ll look back and remember the *motivators*. These are factors like recognition and achievement. They mean that your work is challenging and that you’re learning about topics that you’re intrinsically interested in. 

These are the factors that’ll be the predominant source of your work satisfaction and what contribute to your personal growth.

Here’s the thing though. If the hygiene areas aren’t properly addressed, you won’t feel satisfied regardless of how fulfilling your work is.

No matter how challenging and exciting your work is, if you’re not getting paid what you deserve, you’ll constantly have a nagging thought at the back of your head telling you to leave.

On the other hand, *only* having hygiene areas resolved is the reason why you constantly think something’s missing. You’re puzzled over *why* you’d be unhappy - you have a high status job, plenty of cash, and great coworkers.

But we need challenge and growth to drive us forward. And that’s why the motivators are integral. Without the motivators, we go to bed at night dreaming about what we’d be doing in an alternative world. Just look at these Hacker News posts ([link](https://preview.redd.it/ed99k3mjsfq61.png?width=2360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3d640a23b0b37726ffdb4a3a5cc872601eae7f9)). 

The reason this can be hard to identify in our day to day is because we wrongly assume that just because we’re not fully unsatisfied, we must be satisfied. And when we inevitably don’t get that resounding feeling of congruence with our work, we get puzzled.

One of my favorite examples of someone who prioritized her intrinsic motivators over factors like money or status is [Kristina Lustig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinalustig/). She quit her high paying Director of Design job to retrain as a Software Developer.

It might not have made sense to others around her, but only Kristina knew what motivated her intrinsically.

**Loss Aversion**

Let’s assume you realize you want to make a career change into something more rewarding. Your brain is going to freak out.

It’s going to start screaming:

* What if I don’t like my new job as much as my current one?
* What if I don’t end up happier?
* I can’t change if i don’t make as much money.

The key to overcome this thinking is to *separate short term losses from long term losses.*

So here are a few examples:

* **Short Term**: In the short term, my salary will drop. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, why can't it exceed what I'm making right now?
* **Short Term:** I might have to take an entry level role which feels like a big drop from my current position. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, won't I not only be in a more senior position but also a few steps closer to doing work I enjoy?
* **Short Term**: I might have to give up the stability of my current role. **Long Term**: But 5 years from now, won't I have stability and a new skillset I can leverage?

**The Next Thing**

It’s really easy to fall into the trap of thinking that the nicer office, the next pay raise, or the more prestigious title is what will make us happy. After all, it’s what your friends and family see. It’s the labels that stick.

Instead, we should aim to ask a different set of questions:

* Is this work meaningful to me?
* Is this job going to give me a chance to develop?
* Am I going to learn new things?
* Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement?
* Am I going to be given responsibility?

These are the things that will truly motivate you. The rest is just noise.

The Data Science Trap,vtd6ln,"It is no longer open to question that data scientists in the industry are merely glorified data analysts. Businesses are pouring money into STEM graduates to create colorful charts and BS reporting. Aside from hypothesis testing and linear or logistic regressions, nothing they do comes close to statistics or modeling.

Predatory Data Science IT Companies,xxmctx,"I don't post often on Reddit, but I feel the need to speak out about a recent experience.

I'm a recent grad, May of 2021 with a B.A in Data Science & Statistics (it's an applied math degree). Although I'm a new grad, I'm fortunate to have 1.5 years of professional experience as a data analyst, spanning one internship and two contract roles. However, I am trying to get my foot in the door as a Data Scientist, and am currently participating in an Applied Data Science Program in lieu of a master's (I have my own philosophy of getting a master's degree AKA its too much money and I'd rather use all available resources at my disposal first)

Anywho, the market has been a bit tough in NYC, as I've been unemployed for the last 4 months. I've had countless interviews, final rounds, but the last role eventually gets passed along to another candidate. I'm a good sport about it- until I was contacted by an IT company called Synergistic IT.

They had an entry-level Data Scientist role that I measly applied to. After swiftly scheduling an interview, the day of our phone interview came. It felt rushed, and wasn't very technical. The person over the phone eventually came to describe that this is not a paid role, but rather a service that ""trains"" you until you find a data science role, and that they're a valid IT company that they will allow you to add to your resume. Also, you had to pay for it.

It felt cheap, and my scam radar went off. So I decided to play bait and ask how much it was. The ""interviewer"" became visibly upset when I expressed a level of shock when he told me it was \~$15,000. As I quickly informed him that I was not interested, he tried to get me on the phone and associate my lack of experience in data science to why I cannot enter data science.

""You don't have experience, right? So you pay us, we give you experience, then when your job comes, you will be ok""

I'm sure there's plenty of reasons why I don't have a data science job (yet). But I'm sure by the way this ""interview"" was conducted, this opportunity was nothing more than to exploit new grads with little experience by offering ""experience"".

Just recently turned in my two weeks notice as an analyst,q0n0u7,"Because after a few years of constantly learning and working hard as an analyst, I have accepted a new position as a data scientist at a different company!

My first job was at a small startup-ish company was very new to wanting to use data to drive decision making. The original analyst they had copy-pasted CSVs by hand did everything in Excel pivot tables. I was fresh out of college with my applied math degree, and after 130+ applications I was happy to finally get a job. After learning more about the data this company worked with, I decided there has to be a better way, and I would power through the process. The true thing my undergraduate degree really taught me how to do was break down daunting problems into achievable steps and how to google the right questions, and it was now time to put that to the test.


Taking what measly bit of Python I knew, I started doing things like combining data in pandas and creating analyses in python to allow the data to scale past Excel's limitations. Once I had a working product, I always researched how I could write more efficient code. It took a lot of StackExchange and pandas documentation reading, always trying to learn new processes and techniques. Now I consider myself a data wrangling expert and confident in my Python skills. 

It wasn't an easy road and it really depends on the work you're willing to put into it. There were many times I wanted to give up, let up on the gas and just coast for awhile. But I knew I had to keep going if I wanted to become a data scientist. All the struggles I dealt with, the extremely messy data, researching new techniques to visualize and analyze data extremely helped me get through the interviews and prove I was up for the job at hand - and finally receive that sweet, sweet offer letter.

I also wanted to say thank you because this subreddit has helped me a lot. I don't frequently submit and comment, but reading many different posts and comments has greatly helped me on my career journey. I am just excited and wanted to tell people about it.

Random note: My boss is very upset with me after I told him in a meeting and handed in my resignation letter. He didn't speak to me for three days and said only giving two weeks notice is disrespectful and I am abandoning them at a critical time. I am so glad to be out of there soon and away from their toxic work environment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/q0n0u7/just_recently_turned_in_my_two_weeks_notice_as_an/,Zojiun,515,Career,93,Top - all

Be careful with AI influencers marketing themself as data scientists or data experts,10v75gc,"On LinkedIn I see more and more people labeling them as data scientists, AI experts and what-not offering paid courses, interview training and resume review. Often, they have a non-data-science background and very little experience working as a professional. Quite common to show a previous job as a data scientist with a tenure less than 1 year (or multiple).

I know it can be appealing, as their message is often, everyone can be a data scientist, machine learning engineer or AI expert. Academic and professional degrees are overrated and it’s enough to take a Udemy or Coursera course to become a data scientist (affiliate link included). Simply follow them and buy their resources (which is usually very general advice, you can google in a few minutes).

But the reality is: They are usually not the experts they pretend to be. They typically don’t talk about expert topics, they talk about career, current hypes, and about very high-level projects. Sometimes they have a GitHub account, but they have no commits of just copy-pasted repositories from other people and some very basic entry-level stuff. They are usually on LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube and in podcasts, but never talking about expert topics.

Don’t trust these people and don’t buy courses there. Everything you need is either free of charge or it’s a professional degree. There is no easy-going way to become an expert in any topic. The only good advice these people can give is how to become a fake AI influencer. 

If you are looking for good advice, look for experts with a clear professional track record (several years), academic publications or talks at industry conferences and articles/blogposts about specific expert topics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10v75gc/be_careful_with_ai_influencers_marketing_themself/,rudiXOR,514,Meta,113,Top - all

Completed 48hr take home assessment over the weekend. Rejected top of the morning on Monday.,r540ko,"Feeling so drained.

Start-up gave me a small-ish .db file to make a report and answer some basic questions. The data seemed like a simple subset of their real data, and was definitely geared for a BI type of role. Admittedly my SQL was a little rusty, but I got some quick exploratory visualizations done day 1, pondered about analysis for a day, then completed it along with a powerpoint the next day. It probably should have taken a few hours, but I invested maybe 8-10 total as I'm coming from a straight bio PhD with no work experience.

I know I'm not a superstar, but I didn't think it was half-bad for a rush job. Didn't seem to matter though, as I was rejected by 10AM local time Monday morning. I was gobsmacked and asked at least for a little feedback, not that I'm owed. Crickets so far, and not really expecting to hear back.

Anyway, what are people's feeling on these types of things? On the one hand, it's bollocks that I'm basically working for free, and the other I'm desperately in need of work and unfortunately I am willing to jump through these hoops to land a job.

I no longer believe that an MS in Statistics is an appropriate route for becoming a Data Scientist.,sx9o1g,"When I was working as a data scientist (with a BS), I believed somewhat strongly that Statistics was the proper field for training to become a data scientist--not computer science, not data science, not analytics. Statistics. 

However, now that I'm doing a statistics MS, my perspective has completely flipped. Much of what we're learning is *completely* useless for private sector data science, from my experience. So much pointless math for the sake of math. Incredibly tedious computations. Complicated proofs of irrelevant theorems. Psets that require 20 hours or more to complete, simply because the computations are so intense (page-long integrals, etc.). What's the point?

There's basically no working with data. How can you train in statistics without working with real data? There's no real world value to any of this. My skills as a data scientist/applied statistician are not improving. 

Maybe not all stats programs are like this, but wow, I sure do wish I would've taken a different route.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/sx9o1g/i_no_longer_believe_that_an_ms_in_statistics_is/,randoma1231vd,502,Discussion,173,Top - all

YSK: Your LinkedIn usage patterns affect how many recruiters reach out to you.,u3jk05,"It seems obvious that LinkedIn would try to give recruiters the best possible leads. I think 2 features they use to rank candidates for recruiters are 1) how frequently the profile responds to recruiter messages, and 2) if you've used LinkedIn to apply for jobs. Other possible features might be how much you've used the site in general, and whether you've selected specific job titles you're interested in. I'd be interested to hear if others' experiences align. 

 My experience: when I first set myself as ""open to work"" on LinkedIn (only for recruiters, not publicly in my profile), I wasn't getting many recruiter messages, and the ones I did get were pretty low quality.  I still always responded to them pretty quickly with a rejection. Now, a few months later, I'm getting hit every day by a new recruiter, and the jobs are actually pretty relevant and interesting. Why the change?

I think LinkedIn tracks whether a profile responds to recruiter messages, and prioritizes profiles that communicate well with recruiters. 

Additionally, I recently started applying to some jobs on LinkedIn, whereas before I was just using Indeed. I think that has also increased how ""active"" LinkedIn considers me, and boosts me in recruiter searches. 

TLDR: if you want quality recruiters in your inbox, respond to the bad ones, and maybe submit a few applications through LinkedIn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/u3jk05/ysk_your_linkedin_usage_patterns_affect_how_many/,senorgraves,506,Job Search,67,Top - all

100-days Data Science Challenge!,g20x47,"One month ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fisj71/from_economics_to_data_science/) about starting my curriculum for DS/ML and got lots of great advice, suggestions, and feedback. Through this month I have not skipped a single day and I plan to continue my streak for 100 days. Also, I made some changes in my ""curriculum"" and wanted to provide some updates and feedback on my experience. There's tons of information and resources out there and it's really easy to get overwhelmed (Which I did before I came up with this plan), so maybe this can help others to organize better and get started.

&#x200B;

**Math:**

* Linear Algebra:
   * Udemy course:  [Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/)
   * Book: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00PULZWPC)
   * YouTube: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I've been doing exercises from the book mainly but the Udemy course helps to explain some topics which seem confusing in the book. 3Blue1Brown YT is a great supplement as it helps to visualize all the concepts which are massive for understanding topics and application of the Linear algebra. I'm through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it's must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  


* **Statistical Learning**
   * Book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html)
   * YouTube 1: [Data Science Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos)
   * YouTube 2: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

ITSL is a great introductory book and I'm halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I'm reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it's challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&dchild=1&keywords=think+python&qid=1586982845&s=digital-text&sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Any questions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged! :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/g20x47/100days_data_science_challenge/,Hellr0x,496,Education,66,Top - all
Recruiting (Still) Ain’t Easy: Job Hunting as a Senior Data Scientist,ckdnkf,"There are a whole lot of resources out there discussing how to get your first job in data science, but relatively few about getting that second, third, and fourth job once you’ve finally broken in and paid your dues. To that end, I thought I’d share some statistics and commentary about my most recent job search.

Background: Based out of New York. MS in Statistics, 4+ years in data science proper at 2 different companies, a few years in related quant roles before that.

Current company: a fairly large org in a traditional industry, currently trying to rebrand itself as a tech company, with mixed results so far. Despite our best efforts, data science hasn’t really found its place yet, and probably never will. That was the main reason for my job search.

&#x200B;

The Numbers:

131: companies I applied to, using a mix of online apps, recruiters, and referrals/networking

77: initial callbacks

7: companies I applied to twice and got an interview on the second try

25: take home assignments or HackerRank challenges I was asked to complete

8: take homes I actually did

9: whiteboard or coderpad sessions

5: whiteboard sessions I totally fucked up

18: onsites I was invited to

12: onsites I actually went to

4: times I was ghosted after a final round onsite

42: hours I spent onsite

3: offers I ended up getting

5: months it took from initial round of apps to finally accepting an offer

100: the lowest base salary I was quoted (in thousands)

195: the highest base salary I was quoted

160: the median base salary

&#x200B;

The Aftermath:

Yes, it’s a lot easier to get interviews and callbacks when you’ve already got a data science job. That’s the good news. I don’t even consider myself a great data scientist, I’m probably 70th percentile at best. My GitHub is empty except for 1 side project I did 3 years ago. I don’t write cover letters. My professional network consists of lawyers and vagabonds. Turns out that’s enough! I turned down quite a number of interview requests and next steps. These were the most common reasons:

\-low pay

\-job was essentially product analytics

\-job was essentially software engineering

\-product or industry didn’t interest me

\-team was already quite mature, which makes it less exciting for me

The bad news is that it still takes a while to successfully secure an offer at a company that you actually want to work for. The challenge when you are an experienced candidate is no longer applying to jobs and hoping for a response. The challenge is carving out time (when you already have a day job) to conduct interviews and do take homes, and then hoping that you’re getting good vibes from the manager, the team, and the org at large. You now have the luxury of being picky about where you spend your time.

There are loads of companies who don’t know what they’re doing when it comes to data science or ML, and only a handful that do, while also having an interesting product/challenges and good comp. Everyone knows who those companies are, so everyone who’s good applies to them, and so the competition is still pretty fierce at the highest levels.

Startups vs Enterprise:

There was an interesting split in terms of callbacks by company size and type. I received a grand total of 1 callback from an “enterprise” company. The vast majority of my callbacks were from small-to-mid size companies that could colloquially be described as a “tech startup” or “tech-adjacent”, or through corporate recruiters who made first contact. After a while I stopped even applying to banks, media, insurance companies and any place that used legacy ATS software like Taleo or BrassRing (truly, the black hole of resumes). If they used Lever, Greenhouse or Jobvite instead, then I was golden. It’s funny to think that the course of your career could be so irrevocably shaped by shitty job posting software, but there you go.

Take Homes:

I don’t think anyone I know actively enjoys doing these but they’re apparently the new normal now so you gotta deal with them. The first few I did yielded poor results but over time I hit a nice groove. The key is to comment and explain everything you did (assumptions, reasoning, logic, commentary). My most successful take homes contained roughly the same amount of documentation as actual code.  I used the simplest methods I could because I didn’t want to spend a lot of time on these things, but I made sure to include a mini-report.

Something I Learned:

I eventually realized that the ideal interview process for me would frontload all the technical screening and reserve the onsite for conceptual or high level discussions.  Assign whatever coding screen, stats Q&A or homework you need before bringing someone in.  Ensure that everyone who makes it to your final round has already demonstrated sufficient technical chops.  There's nothing worse for a candidate than carving out a 4 hour chunk of time away from work, then showing up to someone's office just to flunk a whiteboard code sesh at the very top of the morning...and then having to interview for another 3 hours.  All it takes is one mistake and it could torpedo your chances.

Networking (bonus edit):

The thing with networking is that it works really well when it happens.  It's how I got one of my previous jobs: pretty much walked in for coffee and walked out with an offer.  Unfortunately, it's not a magic button you can just press when you need it.  There are a finite supply of senior DS jobs out there,, so you can't rely on it every time you need a change of scenery.  Definitely would recommend meeting people, getting your name out there, etc, but realize that it's more of a long term play than anything else.

Most Embarrassing/Annoying Moments (another bonus edit):

\-forgot how to write a window function

\-interviewer didn't believe common table expressions were valid SQL.  They totally are.

\-couldn't solve a string compression problem quickly/efficiently enough

\-blanked out on a binary search tree problem

\-couldn't quite explain how L1 regularization induces sparsity

\-""What is your greatest weakness?""  Seriously?

\-ghosted by the same company twice.  Fool me once...",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ckdnkf/recruiting_still_aint_easy_job_hunting_as_a/,unsteady_panda,492,Job Search,153,Top - all
Networking - it's not just LinkedIn connections,lbr2fb,"I was chatting with someone here in the sub about LinkedIn, and it made me realize something that I don't think gets discussed in enough detail when talking about job searches: ""networking"".

Most people will (correctly) tell you that networking is the best way to find a job. What most people don't tell you is that not all networking is the same, and not all networking is useful.

For example, I've had at least 1 or 2 fresh grads send me connection requests on LinkedIn asking me for a job for the last like 4 years. Most of the time I'm nice, I accept their request and tell them I unfortunately can't help them.

Technically speaking, these people have ""grown"" their network. Practically speaking, they have not *because there is no actual relationship there*. That is, unless you can create a point of contact *and then use it to create a relationship*, then that is not a real connection. 

So going on LinkedIn and shooting off random connection requests to a bunch of people you don't know and then asking them for jobs isn't going to help you. It's like a 0.001% chance of it having any impact in your job search.

Let's pause for a second and touch on an important topic while we're here: what is the goal of networking when you're looking for a job? It's not ""to get a job"". I want to make this clear: a connection isn't likely going to get you a job. They aren't even likely to get you an interview. The only thing that you should be expecting from a connection is that instead of your resume comingling with the 100s or 1000s of resumes submitted for a role you're interested in, that your resume will be almost surely one of the ones that gets looked at closely. That's it. After that, it's all you - you need to make sure your resume is spectacular, you need to interview well, etc. 

Yes, every once in a while you'll hit a home run and have someone in your network that is literally the hiring manager for a role you want (or has a real close relationship with someone in your network) and then you may be able to jump to the front of the line and go straight to an interview. But that is extremely rare.

Ok back to the original question: how do you network? I would say there are three things you need to focus on:

1. Strengthening/exploring your existing network of real connections (not fake social media ones): family, friends, classmates, professors, etc. People that you actually know and who, in turn, would have at least some predisposition to do nice things for you if you asked them to. If you're in the job market, the first thing you should do is reach out to people in this bubble that may have connections to the industry - and even if you don't think they do, ask. 
2. Finding 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn and having your common connection broker a conversation *that has a purpose*. A 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn is someone who shares a connection with you. So, say you're interested in a job at Company X, and you find that your college roommate is connected to Anne, a recruiter for Company X. You then ask your roommate ""hey, do you know Anne personally? If so, would you mind introducing me to her - I am very interested in their company and would like to see if I could be a good fit for a specific role they have. Also, if you can say some nice things about me that would be cool"". Or if you find a Data Analyst in a company you're interested in that is a common connection with a guy you had a class with, same thing ""Hey Bob, I see that Janet works at a company I'm interested in. If you know her personally, would you be willing to broker a conversation between the two of us? I'd like to get her opinion on whether I am qualified for X job at her company"".
3. Connecting with people with whom you share common interests that are somewhat specific. Say you like building models for fantasy football. There is a community out there of such people, and given that you already have something in common it is very reasonable to say something like ""hey, I see you too like fantasy football analytics. I have been working on this model that does x, y, z and could really use some feedback - and it looks like you've done similar stuff in the past"". If I am this other person, I am 10X more likely to reply to that and engage than I am to ""will you be my connection? I need a job"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/lbr2fb/networking_its_not_just_linkedin_connections/,dfphd,493,,76,Top - all

My F100 company analyzed why our good data scientists are good and here's the recap,16x6t1p,"A small team of internal researchers inside the company spent time investigating which data scientists preformed the best, which preformed the worst, and what factors played into this. 

The top 3 indicators of a high preforming data scientist were:
1. The number one predictor of a preformant data scientist was proactive communication. Be it speaking up in meetings, pinging people in chat, voicing concerns with a work plan, these data scientists communicated on their own initiative and their ability to get things done and make an impact is recognized. 
2. They are capable of flushing out requirements and working on complicated tasks without managerial intervention. A good example of this could be manager says we need to build a model that satisfies xyz objectives and that there are additional business reqs we'll need to flush out. 2 or 3 data scientists go do all the work to get the data and flush out the requirments while making all the plans amongst themselves and basically just keeping the manager in the loop on what's happening. 
3. They focus on adding value over pursuing technical solutions. Often times the simpler modeling approach is good enough and it solves the problem in a quick fashion. 


Things noted about low preforming data scientists were:
1. They were reactive in their communication
2. They often times missed deadlines that they themselves set and never communicated that there were issues or that the deadline would be missed. 
3. They often focus on tasks like attending all of their meetings or immediatly responding to emails rather than meeting project goals and deadlines
4. They focus too much on perfecting the POC solution which later leads to a lot of rework / wasted time.
5. They're overly dismissive in their communication. Weather it be asking for feedback and validation and then disregarding it when it doesn't align with their ideas or simply dismissing the ideas of others in general. 
6. They create drama.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16x6t1p/my_f100_company_analyzed_why_our_good_data/,None,488,Discussion,176,Top - all

Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford (course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford (course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

High School Mathematics, MIT (collection of courses)
In this section we have provided a collection of mathematics courses and resources from across MIT. Some are materials that were used to teach MIT undergraduates, while others were designed specifically for high school students.

Statistics & Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University (course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.

Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Penn State (course)
Courseware for a pair of related courses covers introduction to probability, discrete distributions, continuous distributions, bivariate distributions, ditributions of functions of random variables, estimation, hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, bayesian methods, and more.

 
Mathematics for Data Science & Machine Learning

These are mathematics topics directly related to data science and machine learning. They may include material from courses above, and may also be more elementary than some of above as well. However, they can be useful for brushing up on material you may not have studied in a while, and which is especially pertinent to the practice of data science. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Data Science Math Skills, Duke University (course)
Data science courses contain math—no avoiding that! This course is designed to teach learners the basic math you will need in order to be successful in almost any data science math course and was created for learners who have basic math skills but may not have taken algebra or pre-calculus. Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.

Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft (course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it's not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you'll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.

Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London (specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fn9414/free_mathematics_courses_for_data_science_machine/,None,488,Education,21,Top - all

R vs Python - detailed examples from proficient bilingual programmers,16dk5b6,"As an academic, R was a priority for me to learn over Python.

I'm a tired of interviewing fresh graduates that don't know fundamentals.,10m6kpq,"So I have just wrapped up first round interviews for an open position on my team. I work in banking and most of my career involves building regression or logistic regression models.

One of the trends I've seen since the tech data science boom started is that there just seems to be a drop in the technical level for peoples with masters degree on fundamentals. It seems too many candidates with masters degrees  do not understand mathematical assumptions of most of the models they are using even at a conceptual level.   For example, during the interview I asked most candidates about regression and what assumptions are required.

Nearly every single masters level candidate didn't know why the specific assumptions were made (even if they could correctly list them), could not answer questions on what happens when you violate an assumption, and did not know how to test violation of those assumptions or how to address those issues. Whats disconcerting is these are candidates coming out of professional masters programs from the worlds leading universities and most of them will end up in jobs where modeling error can have multi-million dollar impacts.

For some additional context: The comment here is explicitly here about standard of candidates I interviewed for people with masters degrees. Most of the Ph.D jobs met standards we expect, even though the job does not require one. The job is one that is very specifically related to regression modeling, time series.   


Some clarification: This isn't not having trouble finding candidates post. This is a role at a industry leading firm, and there is no shortage of good candidates.  What I am specifically addressing in this posts is that candidates we are interviewing with masters degrees don't know text book stuff they should know based on whats listed in their resume.

Disillusioned with the field of data science,n1wnp6,"I’ve been in my first data science opportunity for almost a year now and I’m starting to question if I made a mistake entering this field. 

My job is all politics. I’m pulled every which way. I’m constantly interrupted whenever I try to share any ideas. My work is often tossed out. And if I have a good idea, it’s ignored until someone else presents the same idea, then everyone loves it. I’m constantly asked by non-technical people to do things that are incorrect, and when I try to speak up, I’m ignored and my manager doesn’t defend me either. I was promised technical work but I’m stuck working out of excel and PowerPoint while I desperately try to maintain my coding and modeling skills outside of work. 

I’m a woman of color working in a conservative field. I’m exhausted. Is this normal? Do I need to find another field? Are there companies/ types of companies that you recommend I look into that aren’t like this? This isn’t what I thought data science would be.

EDIT: Thank you for the responses everyone! I’ve reached out to some of you privately and will try to respond to everyone else. Based on the comments and some of the suggestions (which were helpful, but already tried), I think it’s time to plan an exit strategy. Being in this environment has led to burnout and mental/physical health is more important than a job. 

To those of you suggesting this as an opportunity to develop soft skills or work on my excel/ppt skills, that’s actually exactly how I pitched it to myself when I first started this role and realized it wouldn’t be as technical as I’d like. But being in an environment like this has actually been detrimental to my soft skills. I’ve lost all confidence in my ability to speak in front of others. And my deck designs are constantly tossed out even after spending hours trying to make them as nice as possible. To anyone else reading this that is experiencing this, you deserve better. You do not have to put up with this in the name of resilience. At a certain point, you are just ramming yourself into a wall over and over again. Others in my organization were getting to work on data science work, so it wasn’t a bait and switch for everyone. Just some of us (coincidentally, all women).

Everything wrong with Zindi data science competition platform.,mdlnvy,"**WARNING:** rant coming

I want to to share my unfortunate experience with Zindi platform. It is a data science competition platform, same as kaggle, but the bounty doesn't usually exceed 2000$, and it is geared more toward African countries.

I participated in a competition there hoping that the company hosting it would hire me if I win. After few weeks I snatched the second place on the leaderboard. I kept slightly improving it for the span of of what's left on the competition. Then, one week before the deadline, I got my account banned.

I opened my email thinking it was some sort of a mistake, I found an email sent by them stating that they banned me under the pretext of ""Collaboration outside of team"". I responded explaining to them that I single handedly worked on the solution of my problem, telling them I'm ready to provide proof if they want. They didn't respond.

Then today, out of sheer luck, I discovered that the team that took my place on the leaderboard when I got banned work as a data scientist for Zindi, which is quite preposterous to say the least.

How can they work in the company and be allowed to participate? Meaning it's in his advantage to ban people who are topping the leaderboard: they eliminate any competition, and they get the money. This explains the very empty, devoid of any logic explanation provided by Zindi as the reason on why they banned me, the such of ""Collaboration outside of team"", without the willingness to elaborate any further, or give sufficient proof, even if my solution out-performs theirs.

It's just insane. I would say stay out of Zindi, it is an unfair community, chances are not equal, and they are not professional. Zindi epitomizes everything wrong with African countries, conflict of interest, lack of respect to people, rentier state, and corruption (ps: I come from an African country).",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mdlnvy/everything_wrong_with_zindi_data_science/,maroxtn,472,Discussion,30,Top - all

PSA: Don’t become DS. Be a DA instead.,17ie7f0,"I’ve been on this board for a few years and noticed a trend. Many people saying they got a MS in DS and complain they only do excel or simple models. Recently, I see a lot of people saying they can’t get DS jobs. Here is the thing, most businesses need a lot more DA then DS. There are so many more basic data needs then complex ones. Most companies I’ve worked for have a ratio of about 5:1 DA to DS. Unless you’re a really strong and savvy DS candidate (smarter then me) you’re probably better off doing DA or SWE. I am a DS director and I spend 80% of my time doing DE and DA because that’s what the business needs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17ie7f0/psa_dont_become_ds_be_a_da_instead/,None,474,Career Discussion,200,Top - all

The Journey Of Problem Solving Using Analytics,myurtx,"In my \~6 years of working in the analytics domain, for most of the Fortune 10 clients, across geographies, one thing I've realized is while people may solve business problems using analytics, the journey is lost somewhere. At the risk of sounding cliche, ***'Enjoy the journey, not the destination"".*** So here's my attempt at creating the problem-solving journey from what I've experienced/learned/failed at.

The framework for problem-solving using analytics is a 3 step process. On we go:

1. **Break the business problem into an analytical problem**  
Let's start this with another cliche - *"" If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"".* This is where a lot of analysts/consultants fail. As soon as a business problem falls into their ears, they straightaway get down to solution-ing, without even a bare attempt at understanding the problem at hand. To tackle this, I (and my team) follow what we call the **CS-FS framework** (extra marks to those who can come up with a better naming).  
The CS-FS framework stands for the Current State - Future State framework.In the CS-FS framework, the first step is to identify the **Current State** of the client, where they're at currently with the problem, followed by the next step, which is to identify the **Desired Future State**, where they want to be after the solution is provided - the insights, the behaviors driven by the insight and finally the outcome driven by the behavior.  
The final, and the most important step of the CS-FS framework is **to identify the gap**, that prevents the client from moving from the Current State to the Desired Future State. This becomes your Analytical Problem, and thus the input for the next step
2. **Find the Analytical Solution to the Analytical Problem**  
Now that you have the business problem converted to an analytical problem, let's look at the data, shall we? \*\*A BIG NO!\*\*  
We will start forming hypotheses around the problem, **WITHOUT BEING BIASED BY THE DATA.** I can't stress this point enough. The process of forming hypotheses should be independent of what data you have available. The correct method to this is after forming all possible hypotheses, you should be looking at the available data, and eliminating those hypotheses for which you don't have data.  
After the hypotheses are formed, you start looking at the data, and then the usual analytical solution follows - understand the data, do some EDA, test for hypotheses, do some ML (if the problem requires it), and yada yada yada. This is the part which most analysts are good at. For example - if the problem revolves around customer churn, this is the step where you'll go ahead with your classification modeling.Let me remind you, the output for this step is just an analytical solution - a classification model for your customer churn problem.   
Most of the time, the people for whom you're solving the problem would not be technically gifted, so they won't understand the Confusion Matrix output of a classification model or the output of an AUC ROC curve. They want you to talk in a language they understand. This is where we take the final road in our journey of problem-solving - the final step
3. **Convert the Analytical Solution to a Business Solution**  
An analytical solution is for computers, a business solution is for humans. And more or less, you'll be dealing with humans who want to understand what your many weeks' worth of effort has produced. You may have just created the most efficient and accurate ML model the world has ever seen, but if the final stakeholder is unable to interpret its meaning, then the whole exercise was useless.  
This is where you will use all your story-boarding experience to actually tell them a story that would start from the current state of their problem to the steps you have taken for them to reach the desired future state. This is where visualization skills, dashboard creation, insight generation, creation of decks come into the picture. Again, when you create dashboards or reports, keep in mind that you're telling a story, and not just laying down a beautiful colored chart on a Power BI or a Tableau dashboard. Each chart, each number on a report should be action-oriented, and part of a larger story.  
Only when someone understands your story, are they most likely going to purchase another book from you. Only when you make the journey beautiful and meaningful for your fellow passengers and stakeholders, will they travel with you again.

With that said, I've reached my destination. I hope you all do too. I'm totally open to criticism/suggestions/improvements that I can make to this journey.

I work maximum 3-4 hours everyday and feel guilty all the time. What can I do to not feel like this?,q2wb8u,"Hello!

My job role mainly involves building dashboards and sometimes data wrangling. I also am passively working on an ML project for my department. I am a good performer and have gotten nice performance review for my first year. My manager is also wants to promote me next year. This is my second year at my first job after Masters.

My work is not challenging so I get stuff done pretty quickly and manage to impress the management, therefore, I have a lot of free time which makes me feel guilty. Guilty about taking decent salary, wasting my time because I don't do self learning every day. I am however trying to find a new job now and have started interviewing but that doesn't help my feeling.

"What were some basic statistical concepts that when mastered, really took you far in solving problems?",odlf3k,"I’ve heard of people taking ML courses and advanced courses like this, but what were some statistical concepts or even basic classes that you took, that may have seemed like something that was merely a prerequisite for another class, but was really something that helped you a lot in your work? And what basic statistical concepts/classes do you really recommend stats majors (like me) to really make sure we have a firm grasp of in order to do well in a job? Or what were some concepts that you got grilled in on interviews?








Edit: Thanks for all of your responses guys! As a stats major in college I’m really seeing how my first and second year probability and statistical inference courses come into
play in the real world problems you guys solve, and how the fundamentals like those mean so much more than just prerequisites for upper level courses. From what I’ve read, it seems like the most important topics i should be an expert on is:

Probability theory (probability distributions, how they are used to model real life phenomena, and their relations to each other)

Statistical Inference &amp; hypothesis testing (being able to quantify uncertainty and interpret results from tests, knowing about properties of estimators, p values and inference in the Bayesian context)

Regression analysis

"Folks, am I crazy in thinking that a person that doesn't have a solid stat/math background should *not* be a data scientist?",uakf25,"So I was just zombie scrolling LinkedIn and a colleague reshared a post by a LinkedIn influencer (yeah yeah I know, why am I bothering...) and it went something like this:

> People use this image <insert mocking meme here> to explain doing machine learning (or data science) without statistics or math.

>Don't get discouraged by it. There's always people wanting to feel superior and the need to advertise it. You don't need to know math or statistics to do #datascience or #machinelearning. Does it help? Yes of course. Just like knowing C can help you understand programming languages but isn't a requirement to build applications with #Python

Now, the bit that concerned me was several hundred people commented along the lines of ""yes, thank you influencer I've been put down by maths/stats people before, you've encouraged me to continue my journey as a data scientist"".  

For the record, we can argue what is meant by a 'data science' job (as 90% of most consist mainly of requirements gathering and data wrangling) or where and how you apply machine learning. But I'm specifically referencing a job where a significant amount of time is spent building a detailed statistical/ML model. 
 
Like, my gut feeling is to shoutout ""this is wrong"" but it's got me wondering, is there any truth to this standpoint? I feel like ultimately it's a loaded question and it depends on the specifics for each of the tonnes of stat/ML modelling roles out there. Put more generally: On one hand, a lot of the actual maths is abstracted away by packages and a decent chunk of the application of inferential stats boils down to heuristic checks of test results. But I mean, on the other hand, how competently can you *analyse* those results if you decide that you're not going to invest in the maths/stats theory as part of your skillset? 

I feel like if I were to interview a candidate that wasn't comfortable with the mats/stats theory I wouldn't be confident in their abilities to build effective models within my team. *You're trying to build a career in mathematical/statistical modelling without having learnt or wanting to learn about the mathematical or statistical models themselves?* is a summary of how I'm feeling about this. 

What's your experience and opinion of people with limited math/stat skills in the field - do you think there is an air of ""snobbery"" and its importance is overstated or do you think that's just an outright dealbreaker?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/uakf25/folks_am_i_crazy_in_thinking_that_a_person_that/,TrollandDie,460,Discussion,225,Top - all
I might have deleted a lot of stuff from a server and I'm absolutely terrified,ss0vh9,"I work as a Machine Learning Engineer. I work out of a e2e server where most of the work stuff is stored an from where it's deployed to cloud.

I gave rm -rf -- /\* instead of rm -rf -- \*/ and it just started deleting everything. I manually interrupted the operation immediately after. But the server has shut down, and nobody is able to login. I think it needs a reboot from whoever has access.

This was Sunday night, which was last night. I told my manager on Slack but he hasn't responded yet.

Im absolutely terrified and I have no idea if any of it can be recovered. I've hardly been able to sleep before I wake up having a panic attack from a horrible dream.

Why do so many of us suck at basic programming?,m5mub0,"It's honestly unbelievable and frustrating how many Data Scientists suck at writing good code.

It's like many of us never learned basic modularity concepts, proper documentation writing skills, nor sometimes basic data structure and algorithms.

Especially when you're going into production how the hell do you expect to meet deadlines? Especially when some poor engineer has to refactor your entire spaghetti of a codebase written in some Jupyter Notebook?

If I'm ever at a position to hire Data Scientists, I'm definitely asking basic modularity questions.

Rant end.

Edit: I should say basic OOP and modular way of thinking. I've read too many codes with way too many interdependencies. Each function should do 1 particular thing colpletely not partly do 20 different things.

Edit 2: Okay so great many of you don't have production needs. But guess what, great many of us have production needs. When you're resource constrained and engineers can't figure out what to do with your code because it's a gigantic spaghetti mess, you're time to market gets delayed by months.

 
Who knows. Spending an hour a day cleaning up your code while doing your R&D could save months in the long-term. That's literally it. Great many of you are clearly super prejudiced and have very entrenched beliefs.

I don't want to be a Data Scientist Anymore,149ea3x,"Wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to read my thread. 

I'm almost 30 years old, and have been in the same career for 8 years. I'm a ""Data Scientist"" with a Bachelors degree in Mathematics & a Minor in CS. My day to day as a Data Scientist is a collection of building/testing/implementing SQL procedures, fitting simple models (Linear Models, Regression Trees, etc.), implementing model results as live models, delivering analysis to decision makers & executives. I work for a major financial institution. 

Here's the problem : I feel so disconnected & unpassionate about my job. It's partially an imposter syndrome issue. Looking at my skillset compared to other data scientists & those who are passionate about Data Science - I'm losing pace. My peers who care about this type of work are deeply involved in improved learning - new Python libraries, new modeling techniques. Everyone in this profession have a strong desire to learn & improve. This has really never been me. I was able to succeed in the mid to late 2010's being fresh out of school & having an ""up to date"" skillset ... but I don't think I have the drive or desire to do what I have to do to keep up in the mid to late 2020's.  

I feel like I fell into this career out of the start of my career, but now a few months away from 30 I'm questioning if this is what I want my next 25 years of work to be. I have friends, family and colleagues who are passionate & driven about work. I feel like this was the career I fell into because of my Math degree. I really don't know what it is I'm passionate about, but working as a data scientist in the financial sector for the next 25 years isn't it (or maybe being a data scientist at all). 

At the same time, I don't want to start my career fresh at the age of 30. I think I'm a naturally analytical person, and want to be able to carry over some of the skills I've picked up from the last 8 years into a new role, that might bring more passion & joy back into my job. 

So, I wanted to see if others on this sub have gone through the same thing. If yes - what were some stories you have that I can use as inspiration? Are there career options out there for ex Data Scientists who don't want to be technical code monkeys anymore, that can leverage some of our analytical backgrounds to thrive?

"To all the data scientists with ADD, here are some tips to help!",i1z83r,"This is anecdotal and has worked for me, I hope it works for you! 

1. Use arrows 
I tend to have so many hot fire ideas and solutions pouring out of my brain, Losing scope of a project. I remedied this by drawing arrows from IDEA to SOLUTION. Using my short attention span to my advantage, I could pour my mind out on paper and link those ideas to solutions, so whenever I need a structure, the arrows offer visual aid; removing the pesky anxious feelings. 

2. Writing diarrhea
Get everything out. When you’re flooded by thoughts, write down one word that associates with that thought. Keep going. You’ll run out of things to write down. If some of these things make sense to you, refer to 1. And draw some arrows! 

3. Tree diagrams and prune
When you’re overwhelmed by what you want to do first, using your word diarrhea and arrows, build from those components. Look at those connections, what makes it achievable to go from a to b? Extend the edges from component a to all it’s children, likewise for b, c and so on. 
COME BACK TO IT AT A LATER TIME!!! This is important. Come back to your mess of words with structured arrows and begin pruning. You may realize that neural net you wanted to program uses too much time! However maintain the links from left to right, from idea to product. 
Here’s an example: 

Idea: I want to predict house prices, product: send as analysis tool to sales team. 

From idea
        Program in python
        Program in c++ 

From product 
       Deliver as REST API 
       Deliver as an excel spreadsheet with formula 


Now you come back at a later time. You notice that you don’t want to program it in c++, and you want to deliver it as a function for excel. Prune that tree. 

4. Meditate at work
Take time off to spend 10 minutes outside or in another room practicing your breath. Keep it simple, think of your breath and let your natural thoughts come in. Try to go back to your breath. 

These worked wonders for me. I spend every morning drawing arrows! We have trello to keep track of our projects, but I’d still get lost anyway. The visual aid of an arrow works wonders for me, and I honestly can’t explain that, however, try it for yourself. 

Writing things down feels like I’m taking a massive shit after a heavy night of curry, once it’s out I feel so relieved. 

I hope this helps, and if you have any

Interviewing is terrible now. They don't treat you with any respect anymore,1802ydm,"I was laid off from my company earlier this year after 1.8 years of successful work experience at this company. I was recognized three times over that period, given merit increases in bonuses, shares of stock as rewards. Constantly praised and recognized several times, and never disciplined in any way or even told that my performance was an issue. I was laid off and they admitted that it was not for performance reasons, I was a great employee, they would love to see me work for them again...

So I start reapplying, I'm very dedicated to working for this company, and the interviews that I get are much more challenging than they were when I started with the company. Previously, they asked me about my background, skills, experience, and had me interview with other people on the team. This time around, I had to do case studies that were extremely challenging. One of them I had 3 hours to go through an absurdly complex Excel assignment that involved three separate spreadsheets of data and building a data lookup tool using Excel. Like, creating a tableau report, just using data validation and dropdowns and stuff and conditional formatting I guess? Sounds stupid and I've never done something so crazy so yep I failed hard. Also had another interview based around SQL, which I know like the back of my hand. Aced the interview, and almost got an offer, but disqualified last round.

Then I had another interview for BI engineer position, and they were “disappointed” with me for not speaking to what SQL I’d used. The manager was honestly a douche, I could tell just from his demeanor, and how he acted. Dude seemed like he was barely invested in the interview. It was supposed to be a meet and greet, NOT an interview, that’s verbatim what I was told. Then I get told I should’ve explained size of my SQL queries, how many rows, types of joins. Like uh, it’s a meet and greet to learn more about the role, and YOU did not ask ME any of that either?

It’s just so infuriating.... 3 years ago, we had 1-3 interviews for low to mid level jobs. Now its 3-8 interviews minimum plus 2+ case studies, for ANY JOB.

How hard data science actually is?,kmkppi,"I have 5 years of experience in this field, I've studied a lot of fancy stuff such as self organizing maps, boltzmann machines, tSNE, bayesian hyperparameter tuning, and a plethora of those cool paraphernalia. But in the most of cases the stakeholders only need some simple bar charts and line plots, some comparatives, some quantiles. And modelling a random forest or logistic regression do a preety good job in general  for tabular data when there is predictive variables.

Don't get me wrong, I love those complicated models, and tried to apply in real life, sometimes with sucess and sometimes not, but in majority of cases is overkill.

I don't know if I'm working in late companies, and if in a modern startup a data scientist need to put a deep learning model  coded in scala every week. Or if really there is a lot of fetishism in data science, and those cool stuff is rarely applied.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kmkppi/how_hard_data_science_actually_is/,None,459,Discussion,186,Top - all
GridSearchCV 2.0 - Up to 10x faster than sklearn,ht26ec,"Hi everyone,

I'm one of the developers that have been working on a package that enables faster hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. We recognized that sklearn's GridSearchCV is too slow, especially for today's larger models and datasets, so we're introducing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn). Just 1 line of code to superpower Grid/Random Search with

* Bayesian Optimization
* Early Stopping
* Distributed Execution using Ray Tune
* GPU support

Check out our blog post here and let us know what you think!

&#x200B;

Installing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn):

`pip install tune-sklearn scikit-optimize ray[tune]` or `pip install tune-sklearn scikit-optimize ""ray[tune]""` depending on your os.

Quick Example:

    from tune_sklearn import TuneSearchCV
    
    # Other imports
    import scipy
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
    
    # Set training and validation sets
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=11000, n_features=1000, n_informative=50, 
                               n_redundant=0, n_classes=10, class_sep=2.5)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=1000)
    
    # Example parameter distributions to tune from SGDClassifier
    # Note the use of tuples instead if Bayesian optimization is desired
    param_dists = {
       'alpha': (1e-4, 1e-1),
       'epsilon': (1e-2, 1e-1)
    }
    
    tune_search = TuneSearchCV(SGDClassifier(),
       param_distributions=param_dists,
       n_iter=2,
       early_stopping=True,
       max_iters=10,

## CHARACTERISTICS OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME

Some of the common signs of imposter syndrome include ([reference](https://so06.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJBS/article/view/521/pdf)):

* Self-doubt
* An inability to realistically assess your competence and skills
* Attributing your success to external factors
* Berating your performance
* Fear that you won’t live up to expectations
* Overachieving
* Sabotaging your own success
* Setting incredibly challenging goals and feeling disappointed when you fall short

## WHAT IS IMPOSTER SYNDROME?

[YouTube Video - The Imposter Syndrome](https://youtu.be/eqhUHyVpAwE)

Imposter syndrome is loosely defined as doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud. It disproportionately affects high-achieving people, who find it difficult to accept their accomplishments. Many Data Scientists question whether they are deserving of accolades, their job, recognition, or the like.

* You do not have enough time to learn something you want to learn.
* You look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don’t have time to learn.
* You feel incompetent.

Why do so many Data Scientists have it?

Data Science is an extremely broad field of study. There are core competencies required to have a successful career in data science, but there is also a lot of industry specific and technical knowledge that is ever changing.  
Data Science is a career which has many job options, all of which require a high level of expertise and knowledge. If the broad, seemingly confused data science job postings show us anything, it is that many companies do not really understand what a data scientist is, how they compare to a data engineer or software engineer, and how to train or support them within an organization. To add to this, the labor market for data scientists in predominantly new graduated or early career professionals.

When challenge is high, and expectations are unknown it encourages people to fall into high arousal, anxiety, and worry. You can see this from psychologist’s [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) flow model.

These feelings are compounded by a lack of support, feedback, and mentorship provided within a company. This is not generally intentional but a product of small data science departments, business executives licking their wounds from years of poor data quality and technical deficit and increasing demand for better data driven outcomes.

## HOW CAN DATA SCIENTISTS DEAL WITH IMPOSTER SYNDROME?

[According to the American Psychology Association](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud), If you recognize yourself in the description of the impostor phenomenon, take heart. There are ways to overcome the belief that you don’t measure up.

In a nutshell, there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome:

* You are a generally competent person.
* There are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you and that’s ok and expected. Even more importantly: you’re not the smartest person in the planet, so if you look hard enough, you’re going to find people that are better than you at everything you do and that’s ok.
* You have a finite amount of time to learn things, and your goal shouldn’t be to learn the most, but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals – generally, this is going to be career advancement, but for some it may be something else.

When the Imposter Syndrome feeling comes up:

1. Remind yourself that you are a competent person – if you weren’t, you wouldn’t have gotten to the position you are in right now, whether that’s graduating from college or leading a data science team (yes, even DS team leaders catch the ‘drome from time to time).
2. Remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area, you are guaranteed to find them – that’s just how it works. People choose to specialize in certain areas, and if you only focus on that area of expertise, you are going to feel inadequate. But even more importantly, recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do, that doesn’t diminish your value – it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special\*
3. Get back to prioritizing what to learn. Do you *need* to learn that or do you just *want* to learn it to feel better about yourself? If the latter, learn to let it go, and focus on the things you need to learn – and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time, which will come.

### TALK TO YOUR MENTORS.

“The thing that made so much of a difference was supportive, encouraging supervision”.

Many have benefited from sharing their feelings with a mentor who helped them recognize that their impostor feelings are both normal and irrational. Though many will often struggle with these feelings, you must be able to recognize personal or professional progress and growth instead of comparing myself to other students and professionals.

### RECOGNIZE YOUR EXPERTISE.

Don’t just look to those who are more experienced, more popular, or more successful for help. Tutoring or working with younger students, for instance, can help you realize how far you’ve come and how much knowledge you have to impart. This can be a great way for a Data Scientist to give back to the industry as well as set a more realistic benchmark of your perceived value.

### REMEMBER WHAT YOU DO WELL.

Psychologists Suzanne Imes, PhD, and Pauline Rose Clance, PhD, in the 1970s, impostor phenomenon occurs among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success.

Imes encourages her clients to make a realistic assessment of their abilities. “Most high achievers are pretty smart people, and many really smart people wish they were geniuses. But most of us aren’t,” she says. “We have areas where we’re quite smart and areas where we’re not so smart.” She suggests writing down the things you’re truly good at, and the areas that might need work. That can help you recognize where you’re doing well, and where there’s legitimate room for improvement.

## REALIZE NO ONE IS PERFECT.

Clance urges people with impostor feelings to stop focusing on perfection. “Do a task ‘well enough,'” she says. It’s also important to take time to appreciate the fruits of your hard work. “Develop and implement rewards for success — learn to celebrate,” she adds.

### CHANGE YOUR THINKING.

>“let the challenge excite you rather than overwhelm you.”

People with impostor feelings must reframe the way they think about their achievements, says Imes. She helps her clients gradually chip away at the superstitious thinking that fuels the impostor cycle. That has best done incrementally, she says. For instance, rather than spending 10 hours on an assignment, you might cut yourself off at eight. Or you may let a friend read a draft that you haven’t yet perfectly polished. “Superstitions need to be changed very gradually because they are so strong,” she says.

Avoid all or nothing thinking. Just like a standard distribution, most Data Scientists fall within the center. If you find yourself comparing to outliers, then you are going to continue to feel like a fraud, which will in return stifle your career in data science.  


[YouTube - How you can use imposter syndrome to your benefit - Mike Cannon-Brookes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkwqZfvbdFw&ab_channel=TED)

### TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP.

For many people with impostor feelings, individual therapy can be extremely helpful. A psychologist or other therapist can give you tools to help you break the cycle of impostor thinking.

The impostor phenomenon is still an experience that tends to fly under the radar. Often the people affected by impostor feelings don’t realize they could be living some other way. They don’t have any idea it’s possible not to feel so anxious and fearful all the time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/nauc4w/in_the_spirit_of_mental_health_month_imposter/,RexRecruiting,453,Discussion,43,Top - all

Failed an interview because of this stat question.,swh10r,"# Update/TLDR:

This post garnered a lot more support and informative responses than I anticipated - thank you to everyone who contributed.

I thought it would be beneficial to others to summarize the key takeaways.

I compiled top-level notions for your perusal, however, I would still suggest going through the comments as there are a lot of very informative and thought-provoking discussions on these topics.

&#x200B;

**Interview Question:**

>"" What if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001?""

The question was surrounded around the idea of accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis.  I believe the interviewer was looking for - How I would interpret the results. Why the p-value changed.  Not much additional information or context was given. 

**Suggested Answers:**

* u/bolivlake \- [The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf)

&#x200B;

* u/LilyTheBet \- Implementing a Bayesian A/B test might yield more transparent results and more practical in business decision making ([https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html))

&#x200B;

* u/glauskies \- Practical significance vs statistical significance. A lot of companies look for practical significance. There are cases where you can reject the null but the alternate hypothesis does not lead to any real-world impact.

&#x200B;

* u/dmlane \- I think the key thing the interviewer wanted to see is that you wouldn’t draw different conclusions from the two experiments.

&#x200B;

* u/Cheaptat \- Possible follow-up questions: how expensive would the change this test is designed to measure be? Was the average impact positive for the business, even if questionably measurable? What would the potential drawback of implementing it be? They may well have wanted you to state some assumptions (reasonable ones, perhaps a few key archetypes) and explain what you’d have done.

&#x200B;

* u/seesplease \- Assuming the null hypothesis is true, you have a 1/20 chance of getting a p-value below 0.05. If you test the same hypothesis twice and a p-value around 0.05 both times with an effect size in the same direction, you just witnessed a \~1/400 event assuming the null is true! Therefore, you should reject the null.

&#x200B;

* u/robml  u/-lawnder  \-Bonferroni's Correction. Common practice to avoid data snooping is that you divide the alpha threshold by the number of tests you conduct. So say I conduct 5 tests with an alpha of 0.05, I would test for an individual alpha of 0.01 to try and curtail any random significance.You divide alpha by the number of tests you do. That's your new alpha.

&#x200B;

* u/Coco_Dirichlet \- Note - If you calculate marginal effects/first differences, for some values of X there could be a significant effect on Y.

&#x200B;

* u/spyke252 \- I think they were specifically trying to test knowledge of what p-hacking is in order to avoid it!

&#x200B;

* u/dcfan105 \- an attempt to test if you'd recognize the problem with making a decision based on whether a single probability is below some arbitrary alpha value. Even if we assume that everything else in the study was solid - large sample size, potential confounding variables controlled for, etc., a p value *that* close the alpha value is clearly not very strong evidence, *especially* if a subsequent p value was just slightly above alpha.

&#x200B;

* u/quantpsychguy \- if you ran the test once and got 0.049 and then again and got 0.051, I'm seeing that the data is changing. It might represent drift of the variables (or may just be due to incomplete data you're testing on).

&#x200B;

* u/oldmangandalfstyle \- understanding to be that p-values are useless outside the context of the coefficient/difference. P-values asymptotically approach zero, so in large samples they are worthless. And also the difference between 0.049 and 0.051 is literally nothing meaningful to me outside the context of the effect size. It’s critical to understand that a p-value is strictly a conditional probability that the null is true given the observed relationship. So if it’s just a probability, and not a hard stop heuristic, how does that change your perspective of its utility?

&#x200B;

* u/24BitEraMan \- It might also be that you are attributing a perfectly fine answer to them deciding not to hire you, when they already knew who they wanted to hire and were simply looking for anything to tell you no.

&#x200B;

**Original Post:**

Long story short, after weeks of interviewing, made it to the final rounds, and got rejected because of this very basic question:

Interviewer: Given you run an A/B test and the alpha is .05 and you get a p-value = .01 what do you do (in regards to accepting/rejecting h0 )?

Me: I would reject the null hypothesis.

Interviewer: Ok... what if you run another test for another problem, alpha = .05 and you get a p-value = .04999 and subsequently you run it once more and get a p-value of .05001 ?

Me: If the first test resulted in a p-value of .04999 and the alpha is .05 I would again reject the null hypothesis. I'm not sure I would keep running tests unless I was not confident with the power analysis and or how the tests were being conducted.

Interviewer: What else could it be?

Me: I would really need to understand what went into the test, what is the goal, are we picking the proper variables to test, are we addressing possible confounders? Did we choose the appropriate risk (alpha/beta) , is our sample size large enough, did we sample correctly (simple,random,independent), was our test run long enough?

Anyways he was not satisfied with my answer and wasn't giving me any follow-up questions to maybe steer me into the answer he was looking for and basically ended it there.

I will add I don't have a background in stats so go easy on me, I thought my answers were more or less on the right track and for some reason he was really trying to throw red herrings at me and play ""gotchas"".

Would love to know if I completely missed something obvious, and it was completely valid to reject me. :) Trying to do better next time.

Floods of junior applicants are forcing companies to erase Data Scientist positions for Senior ones,ln2jnt,"I've been noticing this very insane trend lately of tech companies opening up Data Scientist positions, only to immediately delete them and put up the same exact position, but under a new Senior title with 4 or 5+ years of experience requested.

This is something I did not expect, but I confirmed it with my recruiter friend the other day. She told me that within few days days, they received 400+ applications, mostly juniors without data experience. Since they couldn't go through all of them just to get to those with actual data experience, the company decided to instead reintroduce the same job but radically push up the YOE expected so that they can get to actual viable candidates. In others words, a slow death of 2+ YOE data positions that were once a staple in the industry.

This is crazy to me and I don't know what to think. Normally, with my \~3 YOE I would've qualified for the original data scientist position. But now that these roles have been converted to Senior with 5+ years, I've become suddenly incapable of applying to these positions (auto filters from ATS systems for example). I'm starting to play the blame game, which isn't really healthy behavior, but I don't know where to take out the rage.

I understand that YOE is just a number, but the bigger issue is that there seems to be enough super seniors in the market for companies to feel confident about redirecting their efforts to targeting these super seniors instead of more mid level people (forget college grads or those without any data experience atm), and not feel worried about the potential cost of their actions. This is the most shocking part, that people with 4, 5+ YOE haven't been absorbed into the job market yet in this economy, and these are the people I'm competing against.

**Edit:** all the Data Science jobs I've bookmarked few days ago are ""no longer accepting applications"". This is ridiculous, I bookmark them on the same day the positions came out. Does that mean a) they either stop after two days and receiving 500+ apps or b) are they deleting these positions to reopen new ones with senior titles as I mentioned?

"Seriously, how am I expected to grow in a profession where everyone discourages me from building anything non-trivial",jmwrcr,"**TL;DR:** switched from software engineering to data science 3 years ago looking for a more challenging career. Have had zero technical growth since then. Looking for a way out.

Myself: in my late 20s, started my career as a software engineer (2 YOE), then did a Masters in DS and since then have spent another 3 years as a data scientist (had one job in a mid-size startup and another one in a late-stage startup).

As a SWE, I wanted to switch to data science to have a more intellectually stimulating and rewarding job. Somehow I had this idea that DS would make it possible for me to pair my SWE skills with passion for maths, and I was really looking forward to lots of technical growth and exciting projects. Thinking now that this may have been my biggest career mistake so far as it's been the exact opposite.

Every single senior colleague I've been working with has been explicitly discouraging me from building anything more complex than a logistic regression, and usually suggested that I should implement some simple SQL / if-else solution instead. In fact, 90% of my job has always been data lackey work answering silly ad-hoc questions from stakeholders using SQL or basic pandas. I feel like I haven't learned anything in the last 3 years except for tons of non-transferrable domain knowledge that I deeply don't care about.

I totally get it that as a data scientist, I am expected to provide business value - and not build fancy models. It is just that I no longer see how I can pair being useful with having at least some benefits for my career and technical growth.

I once had this guy on my team who was complaining a lot about DS applicants he was interviewing back then. His problem was with them mentioning ""passion for neural networks"" on their CVs and not being ""down to earth"" enough. The guy then went on to change teams, work as a front-end developer and learn all the fancy React stuff, and then switched teams again to do backend engineering, learn yet another language and use his new skills to tackle some really cool problems.

Like wow, it almost feels as if people in this industry sincerely believe it is okay for a software engineer to keep learning and have lots of technical growth, whereas a data scientist is expected to know their place and be stuck doing SQL / occasionally treat themselves to some very basic ML.

I guess there are some DS positions out there that are not like that but they seem to be incredibly rare, and it feels like every year of this sort of ""experience"" makes it less and less likely for me to ever get into real ML as the market feels so competitive.

I am thinking that I should go back to software engineering while it's not too late. Have some of you guys been in a similar position? What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/jmwrcr/seriously_how_am_i_expected_to_grow_in_a/,ds9329,446,Career,141,Top - all

I got the chance to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team!,gtv2c9,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do & where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard & interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing & analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization & efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

It just seems like such an agonizing amount of busy work: sizing and resizing text boxes and images, dealing with templates, hunting down icons for flowcharts, trying to make everything line up the way it should even though it never really does--all to see my beautiful dynamic dashboards reduced to static cutouts. Bullet points in general seem like a lot of unnecessary violence.

Why is there no interest in Business Analytics?,14ivufl,"My job title is Analytics Manager and I work for a large company that has a formal Business Intelligence/Data Science department. In this org, we are split into 3 parts: 1) Data Engineering, 2) Data Science, and 3) Business Analytics

Data Engineering builds the data pipelines, ETLs, and manages the data warehouse. Data Science works on very specific projects like recommender, search, and customer churn models.

Meanwhile Business Analytics is like the business jobs that are also technical. Their job can be dashboarding, executive reporting, strategy insights, market analytics, etc. but they have to know a lot of SQL and some programming in order to extract the data and transform it into insights. They also need to know business context. It’s like 50% coding and 50% making financial models and/or PowerPoint decks for execs.

When we interview people, especially interns and younger candidates, nobody wants to do BA. Everyone wants to do DS. The ironic thing is the DS jobs are the fewest in quantity and they only hire the most qualified people (usually people with PhDs). All the DE people have backgrounds in CS and the BA people have backgrounds like people on this sub where they usually have a MS in DS or Analytics.

It just seems like the BA jobs are off putting to many candidates. As soon as I mention PowerPoint or excel, I can feel their souls die lol. The truth is it’s part of the job, but there’s more to it than that. I code a lot, I grab data from APIs, I go through developer docs, but yes, I also build decks and am good at it. I think there’s more jobs in this sector and more upside for promotions and job opportunities.

Has ChatGPT killed doomers?,123tx9p,"Sorry for another ChatGPT post but I think it really is the end of asking whether certain job sectors will exist on r/DataScience due to ChatGPT making them redundant.

Whilst reading all of the 100's of doomer posts 'Will Data Science survive because ChatGPT' - it dawned on me that Chat GPT can replace all of the users creating these posts. They've all been made redundant. A simple prompt to an AI like 'Write a profoundly dumb Reddit post asking if Chat GPT has made Data Science redundant' - will return exactly that. With a simple workflow/pipeline the response from the API can be posted directly to r/DataScience.

Advice to all job seekers: be as critical to the company as they are to you,puh45x,"Been seeing a lot of posts recently of people being hired to do data science and ending up in, from a data point of view, suboptimal work places. In my opinion many of these places had red flags from to get go based on the description of the company they gave. 

My main advice is to be as critical to the company as they are to you:

Screen their job posting with as much rigour as they screen your CV trying to get a sense of what you'll *really* be doing irrespective of your 'data scientist' job title. Typical red flags for me would be (not exhaustive):

* No mention of cloud related tooling.
* SQL and data warehousing featuring more promintently than anything else. Reason being that if I wanted to do a DA job, which I really enjoyed from past experiences, I would just apply for that.
* No mention of any kind of version control.
* ""Use whatever tools and languages you want on the job"". This one is very particular but to me that would indicate no standardisation, probably a lot of csv files, excel users, ad-hoc analysis on notebooks and very little being put into production / automated. This might be a pet peeve but I believe in many cases long term value from data can't *just* be done through ad-hoc analyses and 99 % of companies aren't mature enough to let everyone use their own tools without it becoming an unmaintanable mess.
* No mention of anything casual. This one is personal, colleagues are colleagues and not necessarily friends but a workplace with a few social amenities would make being 8-9 hours in the office more bearable.

Not all of the information you value can be gotten from the job posting so the next step would be to think about what you value ahead of the interview and ask them in a polite manner. Job interviews should be as much of you deciding if they are a fit for you as vice versa.

This may help you to uncover small details that can help you decide picking one offer over the other. Even if you only have 1 offer knowing what you're getting into in advance can help you make peace with / prepare for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/puh45x/advice_to_all_job_seekers_be_as_critical_to_the/,None,436,Discussion,54,Top - all

Job is a nightmare - Advice,13peb5z,"Hi. I'm 24F. Recently finished my masters in statistics. Interested in data science and miraculously I was hired to do analysis for two large companies under the same parent group. I was super excited but 3 months later. I'm miserable. 

I thought I would've been able to take some data and clean it up and do some cool analysis on it. But it's so much. I can't handle this. I have to keep track of customer and sales data for two large companies. Most of the data isn't even clean. There's about 5 platforms to keep track of for each. There's stupid meetings every day. Presentations for each company every week. And then in-between that I have to find time to do my own work. I have no personal time. My relationship died.

My boss is an absolute nightmare. A stereotypical corporate bro. The most emotionless uncaring blunt workaholic person I've ever met. I can do nothing right in his eyes. I've never received a list of specific tasks to do. Sometimes I give him insights into some data and he ignores it. I don't care for a bunch of emotional shit but a little bit of empathy or something. And then they're telling me about their plans for me long term in the company and they've already sent me on a trip abroad for training.

I just wanted to use some sales/customer data and do some analysis man. This is too much. How do I even navigate this?

My thoughts(rant) on data science consulting,t1cn0l,"This is gonna be mostly a rant but may make someone think twice if they are thinking of joining a consulting firm as a data scientist.

So, last year I completed my masters and joined one of the big 4 firms as a data scientist. As excited as I was in the beginning, 6 months down the line I’ve started to hate my job.

I always thought working a data science job would make my knowledge base grow, but it seems like in consulting no one gives a damn about your knowledge because no one cares if you’re right, they just want to please the client. Isn’t the point of analysing and modelling data to learn from it, to draw insights? At consulting firms everything is so client oriented that all you end up doing is serving to the client’s bias. It doesn’t matter if you modelled the data right, if the client “thinks” the estimate should be x, it should come out to be x. Then why the hell do you want me to build you a model? 

The job is all about making good looking ppts and achieving estimates the client wants you to and closing the project. There isn’t any belief in the process of data science, no respect for the maths behind it

Edit; People who are commenting, I would love some help regarding my career. What should I do next? What industries are popular for having in-house data scientists who do meaningful jobs? Also, for some context, I’ve a masters in economics.

Edit 2; people who are asking how I didn’t know and saying how it is so obvious, guys, I simply didn’t know. I don’t come from a family of corporate workers. My line of thinking was that no one can be as big without doing something valuable.

Is data science too broad to ever feel prepared for an interview?,n959rr,"I'm a ""data scientist"" that does data engineering.  I get data science interviews from my job title alone.  Does anyone else think data science is too broad of a field to ever feel prepared for the interview.  For example, I feel data science jobs can be broken down into the following types of roles:





1) The typical data scientist: This is what we typically how we imagine a data scientist.  The role involves a bit of data exploration, ML model building, presentations to management, etc.




2) The deep learning data scientist: This is kind of like the previous example, but with a greater emphasis on deep learning over traditional ML.  The role is more likely to ask for a PhD.  This role looks at more interesting problems in my opinion, such as computer vision and NLP.





3) The data engineering data scientist: This is like my current role.  I work on ETL pipelines and bring new data to data scientists in the previous categories for ML model building.  Because of my job title, I might be asked to do some data analysis work.  I work a lot with python, SQL, and AWS.





4) Software Engineer (Data Science): This data scientist is in reality a software engineer attached to a data science team.  This is not as common, but definitely exists.



5) The data analyst with a data scientist job title: With this type of data scientist, there is less python and ML, and more SQL, Excel, and presentations.  Hiring managers typically look at non-technical skills over technical skills.






Those are all the roles I can think of, and I am sure I am missing some.  But assuming you fit one of the categories, it's pretty hard to prepare for all other data science interviews.  Some roles only leetcode you, others might ask SQL questions, others might ask math/stats trivia, others might give you a take home presentation to prepare.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/n959rr/is_data_science_too_broad_to_ever_feel_prepared/,memcpy94,435,Job Search,64,Top - all
Competitive Job Market,lflos5,"Hey all,

At my current job as an ML engineer at a tiny startup (4 people when I joined, now 9), we're currently hiring for a data science role and I thought it might be worth sharing what I'm seeing as we go through the resumes.

We left the job posting up for 1 day, for a Data Science position. We're located in Waterloo, Ontario. For this nobody company, in 24 hours we received 88 applications.

Within these application there are more people with Master's degrees than either a flat Bachelor's or PhD.

I've been on over ~20 coffee chats the last 5 months - here's everything I've learnt so far :),kfaqxq,"I’ve had the chance to meet tons of awesome tech professionals over the last 6 months.

I’ve been curious to find out more about their backgrounds and listen to them describe what it is that they do on a day to day basis.

The number one benefit of doing this has been that I’ve been exposed to a variety of new industries, roles, and opportunities.

I’ve learnt about *why* people have made certain career transitions, how they’ve successfully learnt new skills, and what advice they have for others hoping to do the same.

All I’ve been basically doing is going on coffee chats (over Zoom, of course). And sharing them with everyone on the internet.

Here's what I've learnt so far & I hope you can also leverage coffee chats to advance your data science career.

**What is a Coffee Chat?**

A coffee chat is an informational interview where you find out more about a person’s professional experience and goals.

If there’s only one thing you get from this article, it should be the following: a coffee chat is not a place for you to ask for a job. It may certainly help you land a role in the future (and I’ll talk about this later), but if you’re going into a coffee chat with the sole intent of asking for a job, you’re doing it wrong.

Instead, a good coffee chat’s primary purpose should be to build trust and for both individuals to get to know each other.

**Why You Should Do Coffee Chats**

An obvious reason to go on more coffee chats is to increase your future chances of getting the role you want.

So assuming you want to work at Twitter on their Data Science team, you could go reach out to a data scientist there and speak with them for 30min. Assuming the conversation goes well, you can continue to follow up and stay in touch for a few months.

Then, say a year later, when you apply for a new data scientist role at Twitter, you can get referred, and sometimes you can even skip the whole line and directly meet with the hiring manager.

Another reason to go on a coffee chat is to find out about what a particular job role or industry consists of and to get information on how to break in. Here, you again reach out to someone who’s knowledgeable in a field and then ask them questions regarding what it is that they do.

So for example, let’s say I want to make a career transition into data science. I browse the data science subreddit and read a bunch of how-to posts and come across someone who’s written about their experience transitioning from biology to data science.

I decide that this person can give me useful tips so I send them an email and end up going on a coffee chat with them. This way, I can get direct advice from someone who’s done what I want to do.

If you’re reaching out to someone to ask for a job, you’re not asking for a coffee chat - you’re just asking for an interview. And that’s very different.

**How To Reach Out**

I recommend reaching out via email over Linkedin or Twitter. Everybody checks their email, even if they might not reply to you.

When sending an email to someone you want to go on a coffee chat with, keep it short and be specific. There’s probably a particular reason why you decided to reach out to someone - be sure to mention it in your email.

Here's an example:

***Email*** ***Example:***

In my senior year of college, I wanted to get a job in tech. As an international student, I had to get sponsorship and this was quite a big issue - I wanted to chat with someone who had been through this process before.

I came across Jay's Linkedin profile and realized that he was an international student who also had a similar economics related background to me ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_Linkedin_Profile_1.png)) and had also gotten a job in tech ([link to image](https://www.careerfair.io/assets_coffee_chat/Jay_v2.png)).

So when I reached out to him by email, I made sure to mention these things:

**-------**

*""Hey Jay,*

*International student from Cal, came across your profile - congrats on the job!*

*Wanted to chat about your experience recruiting in tech. Specifically, wanted to ask about:*

1. *How you bring up sponsorship with employers (at what stage, how you frame it etc)*
2. *Your econ background & how this has affected the type of roles you've looked at.*

*Let me know if a quick 20min chat this week would be possible.""*

**--------**

Notice how I didn’t say something generic like: “Would love to pick your brain”

Being specific when reaching out also makes sure that the recipient doesn’t think you’re randomly spamming people and sending the exact same copy to hundreds of people. You’re much more likely to get a response.

Finally, realize that the worst thing that happens is someone says no or doesn’t reply. No big deal, you’re still alive. Realize that most people will ignore your email. That’s okay.

And no, you’re not being “pushy” if you choose to follow-up. Just make sure you’ve taken the steps above to write a good message.

Okay, so let’s assume you’ve got someone to respond and they’re down to have a coffee chat with you. How do you prepare?

**How To Prepare**

Well, firstly, make sure *you do* prepare in advance. Someone’s given you their most valuable asset: their time. Don’t waste it.

When I’m about to speak with someone, I spend a minimum of 1 hour going through their profile and drafting up questions I want to ask them.

I’ll look at their Linkedin profile, see if they’ve published any blog posts, or if they’ve previously spoken on any panels. I’ll compile my notes in a google doc.

If the conversation is going well, you’ll find yourself asking a lot less questions and having a more two-way discussion, but I still recommend doing your research upfront.

When preparing questions, don’t just ask questions you could have looked up. Try to go a layer deeper - so instead of merely asking “Why did you transition into X?”, ask “Given your background in Y, what appealed you to X? Am I right in thinking that given my interests in A & B, I’ll also benefit from a transition into X?”

Ultimately, though, your questions don’t need to be perfect. A coffee chat is just a conversation with another person. And as long as you’re genuinely interested in finding out about their professional journey (rather than begging for a job), you’ll come across well.

**Guiding the Conversation and Asking Questions**

As I hinted at in the last section, whilst you should have a bank of questions to rely on, you don’t want the conversation to just be a series of questions and answers.

Instead, use your questions to add structure to your overall conversation, but let the discussion itself ebb and flow. Go on tangents - if something the other person says catches your interest, don’t be afraid to ask them about it.

There is no script and there shouldn’t be.

Keep in mind, though, that your first few coffee chats *will* likely involve just a bunch of questions and answers. But as you go on more and get more practice, just like anything else, you’ll develop a habit of steering the conversation in a manner that doesn’t involve just Q&A.

Finally, I also recommend taking notes - not necessarily to remember what you discussed, but rather as a tool to highlight the important parts of your conversation and to internalize some of your learnings better.

**Final Thoughts**

Congrats, you’ve just made a new friend!

I recommend following up once right after your chat and sending a nice thank-you note.

Then, in the coming months, if you work on something cool or explore any new opportunities that are related to what you discussed, make sure to let them know!

As a slight tangent - you might be surprised at how many people end up reaching out to *you.*

After one of my coffee chats, I got a recruiter from one of the people I interviewed's company reaching out to me asking if I was interested in a new role they had.

Going on coffee chats is one of the best ways to increase future opportunities that come your way.

All they take is a bit of outreach and prep. And I hope this guide has proven to be a helpful start.

Interview question I generally ask applicants,lrkob9,"Hello all    

I've seen some posts about interview questions here recently and thought I would share some of the questions I ask applicants for our data science positions. Maybe we can have a small discussion on other peoples questions. If you ask why I write this, my small daughter is currently in the hospital and the don't let me in due to Covid rules so I need something to keep me busy (edit: she's fine now).

I currently work in a retail company as a data scientist. We only hire people fresh from university (decision of my bosses) to grow them into the business, usually with master degrees. I studied statistics, therefore it falls to me to assess the statistical knowledge of the applicants.

So what do I look for? We are not a tech or AI company, we need people with a solid understanding of classical statistics, not just ML, as that will be necessary a lot of times. What I want to know is whether the applicant has a good grasp and intuition about statistics. We are a team of people, it is likely someone will know which algorithms and methods might be applicable to your problem, so you don't need to know all the algorithms (you would read up on them anyway), but you need the intuition or training to know that there is a problem (see e.g. my example on multiple testing below). In addition, I personally think that our value doesn't lie in calling fit(X, y), but being able to figure out if the model coming from it is appropriate and useful.

This brings me to the questions I ask. I usually have three questions prepared, which can slightly vary between applicants based on their education. Also I always give applicants my laprop and tell them they can lookup things if they want to.

In the first question, I show a piece of code which generates some data (with p > n) and generates a (collinear) feature. Then a linear model is fitted and the summary printed which is full of NAs. Then I ask them to help me debug why my model gives NAs. This usually leads to a discussion about data quality, features and data preparation.

Then for the second questions, I show the diagnostic plots for a linear regression model I fabricated filled with the usual caveats, heteroskedacity and a missing feature which leads to biased results (e.g. predicts negative values for a strictly positive quantity). Here we have a discussion about model validation and implications of a lack thereof, starting at the given example and then some questions about e.g. cross validation.

And at last my personal favorite, I show people this comic here https://xkcd.com/882/ and ask them to explain it to me. This normally leads to a discussion about p values, hypothesis testing and multiple testing correction, maybe also expectation values. I don't need you to know which algorithm to use (or just p.adjust()), but that you recognize that doing 20 tests without accounting for it is problematic.

This is then followed by a short case study with a problem I solved one or two years ago where I am present and the can discuss with me about what data is available and whether what they propose is feasable. What interests me here the most is not really the idea you come up with but how you get there. What I noticed here is that the people who do well at first try to visualize the problem with some sketches and example cases which really helps them to order their thoughts and me to help them if they get completely stuck.

I hope this read has been helpful or interesting to you, I'd be happy to read about questions you ask in interviews.

Does anyone else feel like their mind is still in work mode even after the end of the work day?,o7twn2,"Hello!

It's just been a year since my first job after graduation and it took me a while to realize this but I just did, that my mind is still working to solve the problem I'm stuck at even on my breaks or while I'm having dinner.

It's not necessarily a bad thing because often those are the times when I actually solve the problem but then again sometimes I am not able to and it's a waste of a break.

Do you guys also can't shut off your mind sometimes and how do you find the perfect balance?

Passed TensorFlow Developer Certification,gc29zj,"Hi,

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

How important was/is work life balance in your mid 20's and what did you do to maintain or destroy it?,n5kuyz,"Hi!

I'm 26 and work as a BI developer/ Data Analyst at a fortune 500 company. My job pays well and I live comfortably. But sometimes I crave a change, a change of company, a change of tools I use at the current job. Using outdated technology right now is kinda the only reason I want to switch.
Then I think if I switch job, it might be a better paying job but could be bad for my work life balance. Right now my work life balance is super, my manager is absolutely fantastic, knows his boundaries, doesn't check my performance in terms of how many hours I'm sitting on my desk.

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

Since I have no financial gain from this site, and no good deed goes unpunished, I decided to take it down. I don't need the aggravation to share useful content and authors if the reward is getting attacked.

I am an awarding winning researcher, as published in at least two national magazines. I don't need anybody else's credibility.

Many articles picked up by the RSS feeds I would be embarrassed to publish under my name.

I am confident that NOBODY, with a clue about data science, thought someone was writing hundreds of articles a week. Especially when posting the ORIGINAL SOURCE, and it links to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR at the bottom of each piece! Seriously!? SERIOUSLY!!!?

I've not made a penny from the site, nor have I ever tried (or wanted to). It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do! I received many thank you notes from authors happy to have extra exposure.

I apologize for my oversite in the way the aggregation algorithm posted. In hindsight, I wish the ""Original Source and Author"" link was on the top rather than the bottom (besides a few other items). I assure you my intent was genuinely excellent; I was trying to give those interested a convenient news aggregation a resource.

I don't create excuses, but please, it is sophomoric to jump from unintentional RSS feed read result to first-degree murder.

Trust me; if anybody worth their weight in Data Science thought you or anybody else got fooled by something so obvious, they would likely think you were in the wrong profession. I asked my 7th-grade daughter to read a few articles and then decipher who the source and author were, and she had NO PROBLEM correctly identifying them (hint, it was not me). I'm pretty sure you can relax.

Again, look at all the ORIGINAL SOURCES and AUTHORS linked to in every case.

I will use the site for personal purposes to save my own time; it got built as my individual RSS reader; I will return it to that.

I apologize to those authors and readers that were happy I had put in the work to create the content aggregation location and add more exposure to others' work. (with zero pay to me)

If you intended to be disruptive, trolling, punitive, and silencing, congratulations, job well done, not worth my time anymore. Honestly, I was getting a little tired of putting in the work anyway. Feel free to navigate the hundreds of sources on your own (yes hundreds); it should only take you 10 or 12 hours a day.

Beware of taking advice from people coming from a fundamentally different background,ee7xuq,"There are several topics on this sub that are highly... partisan for lack of a better word.

What degree to pursue, PhD or not, Python vs. R, etc.

While different people will naturally have different opinions on the subject, I think it's particularly important to recognize that a person's path and past success will heavily bias their opinion.

Successful artists will tell up and coming ones to ""follow their dream"". But the reality is that a more personalized advice should probably be ""follow your dream if you're extremely talented, unique and have the family support to prevent you from ending up homeless"".

I think the same is true of this sub. Not everyone here has the inherent ability to become a Principal Scientist at Google, nor to become the Chief Data Officer for a Fortune 59 company. 
EDIT: I should have said ""not everyone has the right combination of inherent ability, work ethic, and/or life circumstances to become a (...). Inherent ability is one component, but the reality is that there are many reasons why a person may not get there - and not all of them are tied to ability.
Most importantly, not everyone's quality of life will be maximized by pursuing that life.

Every Medium Article Ever Written (#3 will shock you),vazit6,"In today's data-obsessed economy, AI is rapidly taking over every industry: from agriculture to zoos. As a result, data science is a rapidly growing field of career-changers, Bootcamp graduates, PhDs, and the self-taught. But here's some little known secrets that nobody else has probably ever told you:

1. Data Science jobs arent just Kaggle competitions in a office. 
2. Data isn't always clean. 
3. Data Scientists need to show how their models make business' money. 

Right? I was shocked to discover as a young data scientist in fall 2020 that businesses are primarily focused on making money. Before that ground-breaking shift in my worldview I thought data wrangling was ""SELECT * FROM table"".

Ghosted after 4 successful interviews. Why? I feel devastated,l7q12x,"Mid/Late 2020 I applied for a job. A Sr position in a data eng. related field in a digital services global corporation. The job not only looked good because of the tasks, but also because the service offered by this company is specially interesting for me, and is something I am passionate about. So, I decided to go for it, big time.

After 2 screenings, one pure HHRR and another semi technical, hands on trivial challenge, I was invited for the \*big\* technical case round. As I am also working full time and I wanted to make it perfect, I took 1 week off to prepare the case. I applied all I know, and more, I really put a lot of effort and went the extra mile in every detail. Then, the interview/presentation took place. 2:30 hrs. with 4 interviewers, code discussion, modelling, engineering details, deployment... The presentation was perfect, not only the best I have ever done, but also the best I have seen -I also interviewed people since the early 2000s, and I've seen it all. 20 minutes after the presentation, the leading person -my potential future boss- called me to congratulate me for the outcome and confirm I was going to have the last rounds ASAP.

For the last round I spent my whole holidays preparing everything I could think of, and also understanding the profiles of the people I was going to talk to. The last round was a series of more informal chats with top management profiles, all of them went perfectly, good vibes, nice chats, and I was able to cast some light over challenges they face in their business and propose how to tackle them.

Again, soon my potential future boss called me and let me know that everything went perfect and that I should expect news very soon. We also discussed when I could join, home office situation, the profiles of my potential team, etc...

And that's it.

\+9 weeks passed, I never got any further feedback of any kind. After 1 week I sent a short email, nothing. 2 weeks later, a second one, CCing the HHRR partner involved. Nothing. At some point 2-3 weeks later sent a last short email, and nothing. Complete silence. Nothing. I just stopped trying.

I was interviewed by 7, 8 people, I spent weeks on preparation and did an excellent job. I spend +7 hours in interviews. Why do they do this? I do take it personally, this is not only a frustration considering the job, but also a personal insult.

How is this even possible?

Sorry, I needed to vent.

EDIT. Thanks for all the feedback. Some comments are really interesting and considerate. Just a comment: the reason I am -or was- \*devastated\* (!) was the **ghosting**, not the fact that I did not get the job. I know there are multiple factors I do not control in a process, and that´s fine, is part of the game and I get it. But the ghosting is something that I just can´t cope with. I think it´s rude, unprofessional, unnecessary and simply stupid.

My company “wants to sell AI” to our clients… how best to manage expectations of an organization that is nowhere near being ready to deploy anything resembling “AI”?,w44lkv,"For context, I work as a “data scientist” at a very small company, specializing in B2B software. Up until recently, I had my hands in a bunch of different things as “the data guy” - running reports, automating processes, etc. It wasn’t much, but it was honest work. My educational background is statistics/analytics. I have quite a bit more business sense than my colleagues - more attracted to practical matters than the shiny academic questions. 

Out of nowhere, our company undergoes a re-org and I find myself with a new manager, a hefty pay raise, and a “director of data science” role. I’m basically led into a meeting with the C-level members of the company, am told that we are “investing heavily in data science” and told that they “want to sell AI to our clients quickly.” Outside of my salary bump, there isn’t any evidence of additional investment in DS. 

Here’s the rub - in order to sell “AI” to clients, we need data and a team to generate these models. We do not collect nor store client data - at all. Functionally, I am the only member of the team (there is another guy on the team but I’m solidly convinced he has absolutely no idea what he’s talking about - he does nothing, doesn’t understand computers, but has been “an AI expert for over 40 years”). There is a member of the board in particular who thinks data science is a magic wand that can be waved at anything to have magic insights pop out. He’s blustery (“JUST GET THE AI TO TELL US THE ANSWER!!”), highly-involved in minute decisions, and has unrealistically-high expectations of my work. Of course, since I am central to many processes across the organization, this work is in addition to everything I did previously. 

**Tl;dr How do I best go about managing the expectations of business stakeholders who want to go from 0 to Facebook in 6 months?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/w44lkv/my_company_wants_to_sell_ai_to_our_clients_how/,WorkingMusic,407,Discussion,120,Top - all

Best book on Statistics for someone who needs a refresher on statistics?,lovhs0,"I've been browsing online (other reddit sites) and Amazon looking for the best available book on Statistics that covers the basics of Statistics all the way to different methods of hypothesis testing, sampling and experimental design.

There are times I need basic refreshers and reminders on limitations present in each statistical methods when it comes to sampling or multi-variate testing, and I would like to go over the concepts  before I deep dive into developing experiments.

While I know I can do searches online, my preference for books is that it gives me focus and the tone is consistent to allow me to understand the flow of concepts being described in the book.

Would like your recommendation for a book that:

* Focuses on mathematical proof
* Provides detailed overview of methods and describes the limitations and conditions of each test (e.g. What is the description of Chi-Square test? Interpretation of ANOVA test values? Circumstances and underlying conditions needed for each of the methods of hypothesis testing?)
* Uses examples to demonstrate the concepts shared
* Not dense with text (sometimes the authors just love to write so much for no reason)

Just failed an interview but I have a feeling that the interviewer is wrong,mhvr1h,"So I had a technical take-home challenge. Due to having to do machine learning on a laptop and having 100 million records, I took a random sample of the data (or more accurately only 1% because that's all my laptop can handle). I proceeded to do EDA, train data and fit a few models that looked well fitting.

This is retail data and my interviewer immediately told me that my random sample approach is wrong. He said that I should have taken a few stores at random and then used ALL their data (as in full data for all the stores picked) to train the models. According to him, you can't train the model unless you have every single data point for a store. I think that he doesn't seem to understand the concept of random sampling.

I actually think both approaches are reasonable, but that his claim of needing every single data point for a store or you are not getting the ""full picture"" is incorrect.

I failed the challenge due to this issue and that was literally the only thing that was wrong with my solution (according to feedback I asked for) :(

My thoughts on the data science job hunt during COVID-19,gwibmc,"Some background: I have 6 years of DS experience, 2 masters degrees, and spent a few years as a data analyst as well. Laid off from a smaller company in the midwest due to COVID-19 cutbacks.

&#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

Why Managers matter?,ok5xpq,"There was an earlier [discussion about career paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ojobxx/what_are_the_typical_stages_in_a_data_science/), and in writing a reply I ended up writing an entire post, so I figured I would post it as such.

The topic of conversation was ""what is harder to replace: a strong individual contributor or a good manager?"".

Personally, I think they're both equally hard to replace assuming we're comparing apples to apples (e.g., if we're talking about the expert with 20 years of experience, then we should be comparing them to an SVP of DS with 20 years experience).

u/jturp-sc then mentioned that people often undervalue the contribution of managers. Which I think is true of a lot of individual contributors. That is, they see their managers as purely paper pushers, and they tend to greatly underestimate the effort that seemingly simple things like project managent take.

I like to use the following analogy:

When in college, I played in a rec soccer league with a bunch of friends, including my two roommates.

Roommate number 1 was the typical forward - fast, great shot, *loved* to have the ball, loved to score, loved to brag about scoring. Was altogether a very strong player.

Roommate number 2 was the opposite. Low key guy, didn't have a great shot, wasn't very fast. On paper, not a great soccer player. But he had really good vision and was a really good passer.

The last season before roommate 2 left the team we lost one game and played in the finals.

The first season after roommate 2 lef the team we lost all but 1 game. Literally everyone was playing worse. People were getting frustrated at how bad we were playing, so they were making bad decisions and making it even worse.

No one talked about it, but I actually reached out to former roommate and told him - ""dude, without you, we're lost. I never appreciated how much value you brought to this team, but it's so easy to see now"".

Because his job was to create opporuntities. Sure, you still need other people to capitalize on the opportunities, but someone needs to create them first.

In soccer, it means that for a forward to score, someone needs to get them the ball either close to the goal with an open look, or in stride and in space against a single defender. Sure, every once in a while a forward will take on 2-3 guys and score anyway, but that is not a recipe for success - that ends up being more luck than anything. Moreover, for you to win games you need to stop the other team from scoring more goals than your forwards can score. So while your forward may get all the glory in a 1-0 win, what people often forget is that your defense and goalie had to keep that ""0"" intact.

In data science, it means that for a data scientist to build and deploy a model (i.e., to capitalize), *and for the organization to realize and recognize the value of said model*, someone needs to create the opportunity. Someone needs to argue that the model should be built in the first place - that there is a real business problem that can be tackled with data science. Someone needs to get it to the top of the priority queue - convincing leadership that the model should be worked on *now* instead of a different problem. Someone needs to get business stakeholders, IT, software development, etc., to commit time and resources to support the project. And then someone needs to take a good model and cram it down people's throats until they agree to use it.

Not only that, someone needs to make sure that your team doesn't get flooded with shitty request. Someone also needs to make sure that you are constantly advocating for people to get paid market value, to continue to add headcount, to avoid taking on too much tech debt, to have the organization invest in resources, etc.

For the first 2 years of my career as an individual contributor, I was never aware of 90% of that stuff that my boss was doing. At some point I became her right-hand person, and that's when she started sharing some of the things that I didn't get to see. The hour-long meeting to get software to allocate 1/8th of a resource to do QA for one of our projects. The one hour meeting with IT to get us time on the big-ass server to run a simulation that was going to take 1 week and was due in 8 days. The 2-hour meeting with product development about why we can't do the equivalent of reversing physics to deliver on the dumb-ass idea that a salesperson sold to a client. The days/weeks worth of legwork to get us an additional hire approved. The 6-8 standing weekly meetings on her calendar.

All of the sudden I realized ""she is spending 80% of her time doing the things I didn't even know existed, and 20% of her time doing the things I thought were her full time job"".

I also got close with one of our expert data scientists. Great guy - 20 years of experience, a walking statistics encyclopedia, and incredibly nice (to anyone who wasn't an idiot). Do you know what shocked me? The level of respect that he had for the people who weren't in an expert role. He had been around for 20 years, and had gotten to see people like my boss do all the dirty work for him. He got to show up and do the things he enjoyed doing - but he know that the reason for that was that other people in the building were having to go eat shit sandwiches with a smile to keep the operation rolling.

We had two experts who had the opporuntity (more than once) to take over the department and become VP. They both passed. I presume they both laughed first, then passed.

Which one is more valuable? I honestly don't know. I honestly don't think it makes sense to try to establish who is more valuable - you need them both. If you're going to build a world-class (or even good) data science team, you need to have both types. You need to have the people who have a mathematical 6th gear that they can tap into. But you also need the people who have 4-wheel drive and can go 10mph over a swamp.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ok5xpq/why_managers_matter/,dfphd,411,,102,Top - all

Did anyone regret choosing DS as a career or has got disillusioned with it?,l4zbd9,"**TL;DR** I've been a Data Scientist for 6 years now and with time I've grown quite bored and disillusioned with it, and I wanted to figure out if it has happened to anyone else or I'm kinda weird :)

Fellow Data Scientists,

I have a very unusual question to ask you. 

I originally got into the Data and Analytics space working in Operations Research for a large ecommerce and logistic company. From there I became a Data Analyst for a successful mobile app and then a Data Scientist for a boutique consulting company. I currently work on building and deploying ML models for large clients on the Azure ecosystem. I also volunteer as a Project Manager for a Data charity. I basically experienced it all.

Education-wise, I have a MSc in Industrial Engineering and Management with a specialisation in Operations Research / Mathematical Optimisation, and a MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from a top university in the UK, both degrees awareded with Distinction. I also co-authored 7 research papers on ML in journals and conferences.

Sounds like a great career, doesn't it? Actually, I never truly enjoyed it despite Data Science is such a ""cool"" career on paper.

The things that bother me are:

1. I feel I am neither meat nor fish. Not technically skilled enough to be a Software Developer and being more involved in the development of the key features of the product, nor soft skilled enough to play a pivotal role with the Product / Business / Operations Management team.
2. I've experienced how difficult is for a Data Scientist to change career path within an organisation. My experience has always been that people who don't have our background tend to see us like curious animals who only love to play with data and to code, and as a result of that we tend to be pigeonholed into our roles and discarded if any interesting opportunities arise within other departments of the company, despite our Subject Matter Expertise, excitement for the product / business and any soft skills we might have.
3. I've noticed how DSs are almost never recognised and praised by the company's leadership team for their work, as opposed to Business Managers, PMs, SWEs, Marketing Managers and Designers.
4. I miss the ""tangible"" outcome of my work. For most of the day I sit (often lonely) producing code, but I cannot touch nor see the output of my code, and that's frustrating because I feel that I cannot share my achievements with others including my family. I think that if I were a Civil Engineer or even a Software Developer I feel I could feel way more excited about what I produce.

I am not looking for advice on how to mitigate my circumnstances, at the end of the day I've decided that I will retrain myself in the field of Chemical or Sustainable Energy Engineering to overcome this disappointment and work on more ""meaningful"" projects, and if I could go back in time I'd not get into Data Science again. But I wanted to ask if you (or someone you know) have ever felt the same sense of disillusionment, or is it just me (I've asked a few DSs in person and no one has felt like this - apart for not being praised properly).

layoffs at big tech,10fv6hv,"Expected to see atleast a few posts about layoffs at Amazon and Microsoft that happened today...?

I was one of them, laid off from Amazon after 2.5 years there. Anybody else here in the same boat?

Anyway iv been thinking about how this all went down and what I'd do differently to future proof my career.. will share a longer post tomorrow. Today's been a long day.



Update 1- just getting started and will slowly reply to comments..I'm generally upbeat about the turn of events and that's why I said it warrants a separate post I'll hopefully write today. 

For now, here is my outlook moving forward- I plan on focusing on work life balance, following my interests and building my personal portfolio. 
I'm lucky enough  to not have immediate financial worry, the larger issue is my H1B visa. But I have options..

The larger impact this has had in my outlook towards my career and how my employer doesn't define it.

I'm just going to say it - I prefer Spyder,v8qv68,"From my research online, people either use notebooks or they jump straight to VS Code or Pycharm.  This might be an unpopular opinion,  but I prefer Spyder for DS work.  Here are my main reasons:

1) '# % %' creates sections.  I know this exists in VS Code too but the lines disappear if you're not immediately in that section.  It just ends up looking cluttered to me in VS Code.

2) Looking at DFs is so much more pleasing to the eye in Spyder.  You can have the variable explorer open in a different window.  You can view classes in the variable explorer.  

3) Maybe these options exist in VS Code an Pycharm but I'm unaware of it, but I love hot keys to run individual lines or highlighted lines of code.  

4) The debugger works just as well in my opinion.

I tried to make an honest effort to switch to VS Code but sometimes simpler is better.  For DS work, I prefer Spyder.  There!  I said it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/v8qv68/im_just_going_to_say_it_i_prefer_spyder/,BlackLotus8888,398,Tooling,158,Top - all

To provide some context, I am a marketing data analyst (with less than a year of experience in the industry) who just completed a 6-month data science course. I learned a lot from the course, but don't have enough practical experience. This position asks for experience in two ML algorithms  (boosting, clustering).

Low Quality TowardsDataScience & Medium Articles,kv8hpb,"I'm interested in getting people's opinions on DS blog sites like TDS / Medium. When I was a lot less experienced, I'd often find really great articles on TDS that helped me understand some method or concept. As time's gone by, I still do the occasional search to try and find some article that explains a difficult or complex issue but I'm getting the impression that these sites are getting absolutely swamped by extremely low quality articles and it's effectively ruining any usefulness they once had.

Generally, I'm finding the bulk of them fall into one of two categories: 1) An extremely shallow explanation of something or 2) A far too complex explanation that isn't suitable for someone who generally understands DS but not this particular concept. To me, both of these suggest that the author doesn't really know what they're talking about and are essentially just regurgitating content they've found elsewhere.

it strikes me that a lot of the authors I see are students who're basically attempting to drive clicks through clickbait type titles in some effort to boost their reputation or CV.

Am I being too harsh? There are some fantastic DS bloggers / vloggers out there but what makes them great is their ability to explain a topic they understand in depth in a way that makes it easily understandable to the audience. The vast majority of the articles I see these days seem to be by people who either don't have much understanding of the topic and/or don't have the ability to explain it well.

It's a real shame because there's definitely a space online for some kind of DS community where genuine experts can share their knowledge and understanding but it seems to me that's being swamped by the billionth article on 'Linear regression explained simply' by a first year college student.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kv8hpb/low_quality_towardsdatascience_medium_articles/,ghostofkilgore,390,Discussion,153,Top - all

""Guideline for recruitment processes in DS roles""

Can't change it now but based on the comments I think it helped a decent amount of people which is all I wanted to do


.



After a month long process I GOT THE JOB!!! Found out about an hour ago, junior data scientist in the South florida area, 80k a year (100k with performance bonuses plus benefits). 


For anyone who wants advice or to familiarize themselves with how the process was:


Step 1) saw ad on linked in, sent my CV 


Step 2) Email with a take home project, they have us a 1 GB database and we had to make a predictive model for a churn rate after 2 years. Basically we had 5 linked dataframes one with customer information (2 million observations) and then 4 other data sets with 5-15 millions observations. Had to reduce it to one data frame. As in add a variable from the other data sets to the customer one based on customer ID i.e create stuff like age variable, account balance, number of services hired, credit score at the time they applied (trickiest one), and contract duration from the 4 other data sets.


Final DF was 1.5 million then had to filter by desired population, with all the filters the DF was only 35k observations and that's what I ran my models on.


It took about 6 hours but I googled A LOT of stuff #stackoverflow. I could've used mysql for the first part but they asked for the whole script in R or Python (I used R). I kept it simple did a Logit, a random forest and a SVM. Error rate with cross validation was about 15%, svm was the best model, baseline was 30%. Asked to make a ppt.




Step 3)  Phone interview asking about my degree and internship experience, 15 minutes told me at the end they want me to come to a face to face



Step 4) face to face interview, 30 minutes with the heads of the team I'd be in, asked why I like the industry, why this firm, where i see myself down the line, about potentially leaving, in depth questions about my undergrad degree and what I did in my internships. Afterwards they took a 15 questions multiple choice math test, (it was like the generic sat/gre math part). 



Step 5) interview with regional manager 30 minutes, more personal questions, talked a lot about the company and my role, what where my expectations, benefits, etc. At the end he took a 3 question test, one was what the angle of a triangle at 3:15 in a wall clock is, the second was why are manholes round, and another was how many cars do I think were sold in the U.S in 2019. 


Step 6) confirmation call!


My degree was a bs in economics with a specialization in econometrics and a minor in stats! Top 40 school ranked nationally. Hope this helps anyone applying!


.

Edit: Well apparently this is considered a very rigorous process and I agree, I have other friends who got similar jobs with easier processes. However it's my first job right out of college (december grad) and I only had 1 year experience. Also with bonuses I can expect to make about 100k so I think it's fair. Plus now you know if you can do steps 1-5 you're guaranteed to get a job even in the hardest of recruitment processes!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ewclwr/advice_for_anyone_applying_to_entry_level_data/,_alexandermartin,387,Job Search,149,Top - all

Today I had a beautiful moment that I had to share,16h8ovh,"This is going to be somewhat long. I apologize but I have to share. 

Last summer, completely against my will, I was told that I had to manage a high school intern who was in a program to prepare for college. The program was to get hands on experience at a company before they went to school so they could decide a career path with more information on what the day to day is like in the workplace.

When I met this student, he informed me the program randomly placed the kids into jobs blindly. He had no idea what I did or what he was going to do. When I told him I am a data scientist, he was not happy and had no interest at all. He was hoping for a sales or marketing placement as that is more interesting to him.

The first week did not go well at all. He was very disinterested and vocal about it. So at the end of the week we did our required weekly progress report and I just begged him to give it a chance, because if he did poorly, we’re both going to look bad. 

Over the course of the 4 months he was with me, we spent afternoons completing complex problems, learning various programs, and making key business decisions using data driven decision making. I taught him SQL, R, Python, and power bi-automate. The kid was a natural. As a junior in high school he picked everything up faster than any university intern or junior I have ever trained. 

When our time was up. He thanked me for the opportunity and admitted while it was far from a career path he would choose, he learned a lot of valuable lessons and appreciated the experience. I attended his “graduation ceremony” from the program, we said our goodbyes, and parted ways. 


Here is where it gets just crazy. This morning, he sent me a long message on LinkedIn, wondering if I remembered him. And told me how inspiring our time was together. So much so that when he graduated this summer, he decided that he chose his college major (computer science & statistics) because of how gratifying the work we did was and how interested in data he became during our time. 

I’ll admit, I bawled like a baby. I was so honored to receive that message, and it was so gratifying for myself to be able to get through to someone like that.

"I'm the only ""data scientist"" at my company and have lost all motivation and want to leave but feel bad. Any advice?",10vynlk,"Don't want to give too much away, but I'm in my mid-20s and work as the only data scientist at a smallish (<100 people) startup. I'm in my second year in the role, and although I enjoyed my first year very much, I've noticed that I've really been not having a good time lately. There are a few reasons for this:

* I don't have a team. It was pretty fun at first to come in and take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit and answer people's data questions that they'd been stuck with for a long time. But I don't feel like I'm learning anything new anymore, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out how I can make myself progress. My manager is great but does not have a background in data science, and I don't have peers I can discuss my work with.
* Our leadership doesn't really understand data analysis. The CEO is always asking for ""insights"" as if I can just comb through our database and magically come up with recommendations for how to improve the business. In short, because I'm the only person doing any sort of analysis, and our engineering team is pretty lean and doesn't particularly focus on data collection/integrity/etc., it can be hard to even get an analysis started (and I always have to push really hard to e.g. get engineering to set up the data tracking I need). When I have presented data analyses that I've done, I've noticed that the CEO only cares about findings that affirm what he already believes, which is really annoying because at that point, why should I even put in any effort?
* I have to do a lot of stuff that isn't really relevant to my role because I'm the only one who can do it. For example, our finance team relies on me for a lot of important reporting (e.g. when we are talking to investors), and I end up being the person who has to put together long financial reports (which isn't so bad) and audit/reconcile different metrics when they don't look right or don't match between sources (which is really quite terribly boring). To be fair, my job description does include making dashboards and reports, but it's gotten to the point where my day-to-day is often answering questions like ""why doesn't this number \[pulled from our prod database\] not match this other number \[displayed on some dashboard I know nothing about that was made by some random engineer\]"" or ""do we track \[x metric\] somewhere and where can I find it"" (the answer is no, we don't, so I need to go meet with engineering to set it up).
* Finally, our leadership has constantly pivoted business models during the time I've been here. I get that we're in tough times and startups need to be flexible, but at this point, the product is pretty different from what it was when I came in, and I'm not that excited about it anymore. So there isn't even motivation from believing in the product anymore.

I've been thinking a lot about this and feel like I should probably quit my job and find a new one where I am a bit better supported and can have some more mentorship. This is only my second job out of college, and while I've learned a lot from being the only person in this role, I think I want to be in an environment where I can get some more direct guidance - often, I'm not sure if what I'm doing is anywhere near what's considered ""best practice"". But I'd feel bad about just completely ditching the company. My coworkers are so nice, and I'm the only person who knows both our database and our BI platform well enough to generate reports/dashboards efficiently, so I think it would be very bad if I just quit one day, even with a two-week notice.

Any advice on how to deal with this situation? Sorry for the long post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10vynlk/im_the_only_data_scientist_at_my_company_and_have/,throaway05282016,387,Career,108,Top - all

Excel is Gold,j6uqn9,"So i am working for a small/medium sized company with around 80 employees as Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer / you name it. There is no real differentiation. I have my own vm where i run ETL jobs and created a bunch of apis and set up a small UI which nobody uses except me lol. My tasks vary from data cleaning for external applications to performance monitoring of business KPIs, project management, creation of dashboards, A/B testing and modelling, tracking and even scraping our own website. I am mainly using Python for my ETL processes, PowerBI for Dashboards, SQL for... data?! and EXCEL. Lots of Excel and i want to emphasise on why Excel is so awesome (at least in my role, which is not well defined as i pointed out). My usual workflow is: i start with a python script where i merge the needed data (usually a mix of SQL and some csv's and xlsx), add some basic cleaning and calculate some basic KPIs (e.g. some multivariate Regression, some distribution indicators, some aggregates) and then.... EXCEL

So what do i like so much about Excel?

First: Everybody understands it!   
This is key when you dont have a team who all speak python and SQL. Excel is just a great communication Tool. You can show your rough spreadsheet in a Team meeting (especially good in virtual meetings) and show the others your idea and the potential outcome. You can make quick calculations and visuals based on questions and suggestions live. Everybody will be on the same page without going through abstract equations or code. I made the experience that its usually the specific cases that matter. Its that one row in your sheet which you go through from beginning to end and people will get it when they see the numbers. This way you can quickly interact with the skillset of your team and get useful information about possible flaws or enhancements of your first approach of the model.

Second: Scrolling is king!  
I often encounter the problem of developing very specific KPIs/ Indicators on a very very dirty dataset. I usually have a soffisticated idea on how the metric can be modelled but usually the results are messy and i dont know why. And no: its not just outliers :D There are so many business related factors that can play a role that are very difficult to have in mind all the time. Like what kind of distribution channel was used for the sales, was the item advertised, were vouchers used, where there problems with the ledger, the warehouse, .... the list goes on. So to get hold of the mess i really like scrolling data. And almost all the time i find simething that inspires me on how to improve my model, either by adding filters or just understanding the problem a little bit better. And Excel is in my opinion just the best tool for the task. Its just so easy to quickly format and filter your data in order to identify possible issues. I love pivoting in excel, its just awesome easy. And scrolling through the data gives me the feeling of beeing close to the things happening in the business. Its like beeing on the street and talking to the people :D

Third (and last): Mockups and mapping

In order to simulate edge cases of your model without writing unit-tests for which you dont have time, i find it very useful to create small mockup tables where you can test your idea. This is especially usieful for the development of features for your model. I often found that the feature that i was trying to extract did not behave in the way i intended. Sure you can quickly generate some random table in python but often random is not what you want. you want to test specific cases and see if the feature makes sense in that case.  
Then you have mapping of values or classes or whatever. Since excel is just so comfortable it is just the best for this task. I often encountered that mapping rules are very fuzzy defined in the business. Sometimes a bunch of stakeholders is involved and everybody just needs to check for themselves to see if their needs are represented. After the process is finished that map can go to SQL and eventually updates are done. But in that eary stage Excel is just the way to go.

Of course Excel is at the same time very limited and it is crucial to know its limits. There is a close limit of rows and columns that can be processed without hassle on an average computer. Its not supposed to be part of an ETL process. Things can easily go wrong.   
But it is very often the best starting point.

I hope you like Excel as much as me (and hate it at the same time) and if not: consider!

You all need to think more like a company when working in a company.,16m7re1,"There's been a lot of complaining about stakeholders expectations on data scientists here lately.

This is not a good mindset and it's certainly not a good influence on those here new to the field.

&#x200B;

1. (almost) Every employer is in the business of making money. We are paid well because (presumably) what we do makes that goal happen more. It's that simple. But the work a data scientist does is not valuable if it does not end up either making more money enter the company, or making less money leave the company. If you are working on a project and you can not explain how it will result in one or both of those things happening (indirectly counts), you need to take a step back and figure that out.
2. If sales or leadership is asking you to give them simple explanations, it's not because they need you to explain your degree in three sentences. They are asking you to explain *which actual outcome becomes different when whatever you are building is added*, so that they can *help you sell your work to customers or downstream users,* and for you to indicate *what time and resources you need to make that happen*. Again, if you can not identify the action or decision which ends up different once your solution is in place, and describe how you optimize that outcome, you should be sceptical as to whether it is actually impactful.
3. When you are asked to outline deliverables, they are *letting you explain to them in what way you prefer to deliver your value added*. That is giving you the power. They are not asking you to do more work in a shorter time. They are asking you what will come out of your work, and what steps you (and they) will need to take to make that outcome happen. *Surely* the work you did two weeks ago (last sprint, if you will) is feeding into work you are doing now or at some point down the line. *The way it does so - is the deliverable of the work you did two weeks ago*. Even if that is a documented (positive or negative) outcome of an experiment. I refuse to believe that people with a master's degree or PhD in an engineering- or scientific field are not able to break their work down into steps if they put their mind to it.

I researched the origin of Unlimited PTO (at Netflix) and wrote up a case study :),nqnrs6,"Unlimited PTO (paid-time-off). Some love it, others think it’s a scam.

But it’s worth exploring why this policy was implemented in the first place. And for that, we go back to the early days at Netflix.

It’s 2003. Netflix is galloping along in pursuit of Blockbuster. There’s a buzz around the office. The chase is on and an employee asks:

*""'We are all working online some weekends, responding to emails at odd hours, taking off an afternoon for personal time. We don't track hours worked per day or week. Why are we tracking days of vacation per year?""*

Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, doesn’t really have a great answer. After all, he’s always judged performance without looking at hours. Get the job done in 1 hour or 10 hours? Doesn’t matter as long as you're doing good work.

Hastings also realizes that some of the best ideas at work come after someone’s just taken vacation. They’ve got the mental bandwidth to think about their work in a fresh, creative manner. Something that’s not possible if you’re clocking in and out without any rest.

So Hastings decides to pull the trigger. He introduces Netflix’s *No Vacation Policy* which puts the onus on their employees to decide when and how much vacation they need to take.

In his book, *No Rules Rules*, Hastings describes getting nightmares when he first introduced this policy. In one of these nightmares, he’d drive to the office, park his car, and walk into a completely empty building.

Those nightmares, minus a few blips which we’ll get to in a bit, never really materialized. The policy was a success and soon other companies in the Valley started copying Netflix. Everybody wanted the best talent and implementing a no rules vacation policy seemed like a great differentiator.

Except that the same policy which worked so well for Netflix...wasn’t working for anyone else.

Other companies found that after implementing an unlimited PTO type policy, employees paradoxically started to take *less* vacation. They would worry that their co-workers would think they were slacking off or that they would get left behind come promotion time.

Hastings was surprised. After a bit of digging, he realized the reason behind why these policies had failed.

The leaders at these companies were not modelling big vacation taking.

Indeed, if the execs were only taking 10 days off, then the unlimited plan would deter other employees from taking anywhere near that amount or more than that.

As Hastings put it:

*“In the absence of a policy, the amount of vacation people take largely reflects what they see their boss and colleagues taking.”*

**Modelling others around you**

This concept of modelling others around us applies not only to vacation taking, but to all sorts of behaviors. As we continue to move towards a new distributed, remote-first workforce, there’s going to be a lot of ambiguity in the decisions that we need to make.

The companies that are able to best adapt to this changing environment will be the ones in which leaders model the right set of behaviors.

A big one will be written communication. As the ability to just randomly walk up to someone at the office and ask them a question subsides, we’ll need to document our practices much better and be able to communicate much more efficiently.

The more we see others, especially our leaders, invest in written communication and take the time to get better at it, the more we will do it.

And never mind us seeing them do this. Reed Hastings wants them to shout loud and clear just how much vacation they’re taking or just how much they’re investing in themselves, so as to encourage everyone else to do it.

An example of good modelling in practice is Evernote. The company, which also doesn’t limit employee vacation days, actually gives a $1,000 stipend to anyone who takes an entire week off in order to encourage vacation taking ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2013/08/13/the-catch-of-having-an-unlimited-vacation-policy/)).

**Other Things**

Okay, so there was one more thing that Reed Hastings found out. It wasn’t enough for leaders to just model the right behavior. They also had to set context and guidelines.

Reed realized this when it was the end of quarter and his accounting team was supposed to be closing up their financial books. But a member of the team, in an attempt to avoid the annual crunch period, took off the first two weeks of January. No bueno.

So Reed decided to put in place clear parameters and guidelines on what was acceptable within the context of taking time off. For example, it was imperative to mention things like how many people taking time off at the same time is acceptable and how managers must be notified well in advance of any such long vacations.

This would help prevent blows like the one above in the accounting department.

**Conclusion**

In the end, it seems like Unlimited PTO can work, but it also needs to be supported with strong management. Individuals need to model big vacation taking and put into place the right guidelines.

But I think the lessons here go beyond just vacation.

The behaviors we see and notice from those around us eventually have a strong impact on the type of people that we become. This is especially true at the managerial level, where the impact is 1 to N and can result in considerable [cultural debt](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/cultural-debt).

So just like this question of unlimited vacation, the answer usually lies in its implementation. Context is king. But that does't always make for good headlines, now, does it.

Normalize writing good code,150rn3c,"The hardest part of ML is reading code written by other data scientists. Even code written by the highest level ML practitioners is atrocious. It is hard to learn new things from poorly written code. You either spend way too much time trying to follow their confusing logic, or you simply copy and paste and dont learn anything. It doesnt have to be this way!

Can we normalize coding good practices in data science?

Here are some suggestions:
1. Stop using long functions. Break complex logic into pieces.
2. Stop using massive one-liners to do complex data manipulation
3. Use type annotations and type hinting in function declarations
4. Use docstrings to describe what a function does, its inputs, and return values and types

"Rant: If your company's interview process can be ""practiced"" for, it's probably not a very good one",n9aj13,"The data science interview process is something that we have seen evolve over the last 5-10 years, taking on several shapes and hitting specific fads along the way. Back when DS got popular, the process was a lot like every other interview process - questions about your resume, some questions about technical topics to make sure that you knew what a person in that role should know, etc.

Then came the ""well, Google asks people these weird, seemingly nonsensical questions and it helps them *understand how you think!"".* So that became the big trend - how many ping pong balls can you fit into this room, how many pizzas are sold in Manhattan every day, etc.

Then came the behavioralists. Everything can be figured out by asking questions of the format ""tell me about a time when..."".

Then came leetcode (which is still alive).

Then came the FAANG ""product interview"", which has now bred literal online courses in how to pass the product interview.

I hit the breaking point of frustration a week ago when I engaged with a recruiter at one of these companies and I was sent a link to several medium articles to prepare for the interview, including one with a line so tone-deaf (not to be coming from the author of the article, but to be coming from the recruiter) that it left me speechless:

>As I describe my own experience, I can’t help thinking of a **common misconception** I often hear: it’s not possible to gain the knowledge on product/experimentation without real experience. I firmly disagree. I did not have any prior experience in product or A/B testing, but I believed that those skills could be gained by reading, listening, thinking, and summarizing. 

I'll stop here for a second, beacause I know I'm going to get flooded hate. I agree  - you can 100% acquire enough knowledge about a topic to pass ""know"" enough to pass a screening. However, there is always a gap between knowing something on paper and in practice - and in fact, that is *exactly* the gap that you're trying to quantify during an interview process.  

And this is the core of my issue with interview processes of this kind: if the interview process is one that a person can prepare for, then what you are evaluating people on isn't their ability to the job - you're just evaluating them on their ability to prepare for your interview process. And no matter how strong you think the interview process is as a proxy for that person's ability to do the actual job, the more efficiently someone can prepare for the interview, the weaker that proxy becomes.

To give an analogy - I could probably get an average 12 year old to pass a calculus test without them ever actually understanding calculus if someone told me in advance what were the 20 most likely questions to be asked. If I know the test is going to require taking the derivative of 10 functions, and I knew what were the 20 most common functions, I can probably get someone to get 6 out of 10 questions right and pass with a C-. 

It's actually one of the things that instructors in math courses always try (and it's not easy) to accomplish - giving questions that are not foreign enough to completely trip up a student, while simultaneously different enough to not be solvable through sheer memorization. 

As others have mentioned in the past, part of what is challenging about designing interview processes is controlling for the fact that most people are bad at interviewing. The more scripted, structured, rigid the interview process is, the easier it is to ensure that interviewers can execute the process correctly (and unbiasedly).

The problem - the trade-off - is that in doing so you are potentially developing a really bad process. That is, you may be sacrificing accuracy for precision. 

Is there a magical answer? Probably not. The answer is probably to invest more time and resources in ensuring that interviewers can be equal parts unpredictable in the nature of their questions and predictable in how they execute and evaluate said questions. 

But I think it is very much needed to start talking about how this process is likely broken - and that the quality of hires that these companies are making is much more driven by their brand, compensation, and ability to attract high quality hires than it is by filtering out the best ones out of their candidate pool.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/n9aj13/rant_if_your_companys_interview_process_can_be/,dfphd,375,,96,Top - all
Ghost papers provided by ChatGPT,1114q7e,"So, I started using ChatGPT to gather literature references for my scientific project. Love the information it gives me, clear, accurate and so far correct. It will also give me papers supporting these findings when asked. 

HOWEVER, none of these papers actually exist. I can't find them on google scholar, google, or anywhere else. They can't be found by title or author names. When I ask it for a DOI it happily provides one, but it either is not taken or leads to a different paper that has nothing to do with the topic. I thought translations from different languages could be the cause and it was actually a thing for some papers, but not even the english ones could be traced anywhere online.

Does ChatGPR just generate random papers that look damn much like real ones?

Is it just me or does it sometimes feel like DS only provides marginal value or of no value to a company?,otbote,"I've been working in a DS role but sometimes I feel like our clients don't really care much about the data science work being done. They seem more interested in the purely technical stuff (i.e. DevOps, cloud migration, etc) or just the pretty Tableau dashboards. Now, don't get me wrong, I understand these are quite important and it makes sense why a client would really like these. But for data science tasks presented they seem more ""That's interesting, but meh. Anyways, about that serverless architecture"".

So I'm not sure if it's just the clients I work with, but I also see job postings and there are way more infrastructure/cloud/data engineer postings than data science or ML Engineer jobs.

Does anyone else feel that way? Or is it widely accepted that for many companies, data science does not yet provide much value?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/otbote/is_it_just_me_or_does_it_sometimes_feel_like_ds/,None,372,Discussion,149,Top - all

Hostile members of an interview panel - how to handle it?,mgczg1,"I had this happen twice during my 2 months of a job search. I am not sure if I am the problem and how to deal with it.

This is usually into multi-stage interview process when I have to present a technical solution or a case study. It's a week long take home task that I spend easily 20-30 hours on of my free time because I don't like submitting low quality work (I could finish it in 10 hours if I really did the bare minimum).

So after all this, I have to present it to a panel. Usually on my first or second slide, basically that just describes my background, someone cuts in. First time it happened, a most senior guy cut in and said that he doesn't think some of my research interests are exactly relevant to this role. I tried nicely to give him few examples of situations that they would be relevant in and he said ""Yeah sure but they are not relevant in other situations"". I mean, it's on my CV, why even let me invest all the time in a presentation if it's a problem? So from that point on, the same person interrupts every slide and derails the whole talk with irrelevant points. Instead of presenting what I worked so hard on, I end up feeling like I was under attack the entire time and don't even get to 1/3 of the presentation. Other panel members are usually silent and some ask couple of normal questions.

Second time it happened (today), I was presenting Kaggle type model fitting exercise. On my third slide, a panel member interrupts and asks me ""so how many of item x does out store sell per day on average?"" I said I don't know off the top of my head. He presses further: but how many? guess? I said ""Umm 15?"", He does ""that's not even close, see someone with retail data science experience would know that"". Again, it's on my CV that I don't have retail experience so why bother? The whole tone is snippy and hostile and it also takes over the presentation without me even getting to present technical work I did.

I was in tears after the interviews ended (I held it together during an interview). I come from a related field that never had this type of interview process. I am now hesitant to actually even apply to any more data science jobs. I don't know if I can spend 20-30 hours on a take home task again. It's absolutely draining.

Why do interviewers do that? Also, how to best respond? In another situation I would say ""hold your questions until the end of the presentation"". Here I also said that my preference is to answer questions after but the panel ignored it. I am not sure what to do. I feel like disconnecting from Zoom when it starts going that way as I already know I am not getting the offer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mgczg1/hostile_members_of_an_interview_panel_how_to/,Friendly-Cat-79,377,Job Search,278,Top - all
[Meta] What exactly is this subreddit supposed to be for?,kkbycj,"The description states, ""A place for data science practitioners and professionals to discuss and debate data science career questions"" while rule number one reads ""Stay On Topic: A place for DS practitioners, amateur and professional, to discuss and debate topics relating to data science."" So which is it? A place to discuss data science career questions or a place to discuss topics relating to data science?

Additionally, on the [a meta post from six months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hdmbkd/meta_state_of_the_subreddit_2020/), the moderators write

""We aren't trying to be a place for academic/technical discussions, since subreddits like [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/), [r/AskStatistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/), and [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/) already cover those areas more specifically""

and

""We aren't trying to be a place for learning about, transitioning into, or getting a job in data science, since there are countless other blogs and websites discussing how to do that""

So, we can write about data science topics as long as the topic isn't technical and we can write about career questions as long as the question isn't about getting a job?

Resume/Application Advice & Comments for entry-level applicants,tgd8ce,"Context: I just completed the process of hiring for a Jr. DS role. We had \~100 applications in one week. I personally read every resume because it's the first time I am working with this recruiter and needed to establish some alignment around what we're looking for. This isn't for a FAANG-type company - we're a sizable company, we're somewhere in tech, but we're not a creme de la creme-type company. 

First of all, some general observations:

* \~70% of applications were from people with an MS in DS
* \~70% of applications required H1B sponsorship
* The most common applicant profile was someone with a BS in something technical from a foreign school, who had then gotten an MS in DS from a somewhat reputable program in the US and would require H1B sponsorship.
* \~20% of applicants had some real world experience in data science
* The final slate of candidates were: 
   * Someone with a research-based MS degree in STEM from a very good US school where they had done ML work.
   * Someone with an MS in DS that already had experience in DS post-graduation
   * Someone with a BS and MS in math/quantitative finance/economics from a very good US school with several strong internships

Some general comments:

1. I see a lot of people (and I did when I was an entry-level applicant) who take the mindset of ""hey, I'm plenty smart for this role. I know I can learn what I need to learn to contribute, so why is no one giving me a chance?"". The answer has less to do with you and more to do with the fact that you're competing with 150 other people. And some of them have a fundamentally stronger background than you. So you need to change your mindset - when you get rejected, it's not because you're not good enough for the job. It's because there is just someone better.
2. If you do not need H1B sponsorship, make that clearly obvious in your resume. Especially if you have a foreign name (like me), degrees from a foreign university, etc. Don't give anyone any reason to asssume that you may need H1B sponsorship. Also - OPT doesn't count. Don't tell a recruiter that you don't need sponsorship to then tell them you're on OPT so you won't need sposorship for the next 3 years. That's just wasting everyone's time. Companies are either ok hiring F1 students or not. 
3. As an entry-level candidate, your focus should **not** be on portraying yourself as someone who knows everything - both on your resume and in person. That is, if you are an entry-level candidates, you cannot - almost by definition - be strong in every area of DS. Because of that, instead of trying to hype up every angle to look like a perfect candidate, in my experience you are better off picking your true strengths and doubling down on those - and being transparent as to where your weaknesses lie. For example - the most common one for fresh grads is not having real world experience working in a business environment. Don't try to convince me that your 3 month internship made you an expert in dealing with stakeholders. You're just wasting time. Instead, tell me ""yeah, I have limited experience in a real-world setting, but I'm really excited to jump into that environment and learn what I need to contribute"". 
4. You don't need an objective in your resume, *unless* you are making a career pivot or took an unconventional path to DS. If you got a MS in e.g. Sociology, but you did a lot of ML work in that progam, then you *have* to include that in an up-front statement. You can't wait for someone to get through your entire resume to figure that out. Why? Because you get 6-10 seconds to convince me that I should keep reading your resume. So if in those 10 seconds I did not see something that tells me ""yes, this story makes sense for a data scientist"", I am going to move on. Same if you're moving from a tangentially related role - you're going to want to explain up-front why I should believe that you can make that transition.
5. Stick to one page. If you're an entry-level candidate, there is no reason to have 2 pages. Again, it just makes it more likely that the person reading it will miss something you wanted them to see.
6. Along those lines - make the information that you think makes the best case for your candidacy easy to spot in your resume. To me, that breaks down into two options:
   1. If your education is strongest, put your education first, followed by your work experience.
   2. If your work experience is strong, put work experience first and put your education at the end (where it's easy to find). 
7. Do not shy away from listing non-DS or non-STEM experience. If you have limited work experience in DS, but spent 3 years working as a Manager at Applebees while in college? I want to know that. That tells me several things about you - firstly, that you worked during college. Secondly, that you have experience managing clients. Thirdly, that you have experience working in a chaotic environment. Short of telling me you have an onlyfans business, almost all experience is worth listing.
8. When listing team projects, please list what *you* worked on. Don't give me the broad description - focus on what you did.
9. Generaly speaking, there are two things that will make a hiring manager interested in you: experience, or potential. So, if I have candidate A who has solid experience doing what I need someone in this role to do, the way a different candidate B can have a chance without having that experience is to convince me that (obviously with some onboarding/training) they could be an even better candidate than A if given time. That will normally rely on candidate B having done really impressive things - whether it's in the classroom, research, internships, etc.

Remote work is going to be bad for us within 5 years or so,u17ot0,"Ever since the great resignation and the great switch to remote work, I've been bombarded by messages from recruiters on LinkedIn. Which seemed like a great thing, at first, but now that I've actually responded to some of them and seen how the job search is changing, I'm getting a little nervous about the future.

Interviews are *much* longer and *much* more demanding than they used to be. You meet with, like, 15 people, and if any single thing goes wrong -- one of them doesn't click with you, or your salary expectations are a bit higher than they expected, or whatever it might be -- they no longer just say: ""Well, he's the best we've got."" They wait, because they know that, somewhere in the world, the perfect candidate is out there.

That's frustrating -- but it's not what scares me.

What scares me is that my company and some of the other companies we are working with are starting to realize that the perfect candidate doesn't *have* to be in the USA.

We've started contracting out Dev and Data Engineering work to people in India, Croatia, and Bangladesh that will work and honestly do a great job for a fraction of the salaries we expect here.

I don't think companies have realized it yet, but I think they're starting to. Non-managerial, non-customer-facing technical roles can easily be outsourced to second and third-world countries, and, if they do, the tech sector is going to go through everything factory workers in the USA have already experienced.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/u17ot0/remote_work_is_going_to_be_bad_for_us_within_5/,takenorinvalid,371,Discussion,233,Top - all

I need to show how grateful I am to this sub,1b8ym5o,"Thanks you guys fpr every single book recommendation, for every single career advice.

I took your recommendations seriously, studied the books you told me to study, and studied other videos on my own, learning everything I can learn on my own.

Then I took the advice someone here told is to talk to someone internally in the data science team, turns out, they were impressed by the scope of the projects I worked on for a sales analyst and how I improved everything data-related in the department and the lead told me once I am ready (I still have a probability course to finish and recap hands on ML) and I will be up for a transfer.

I will be a junior DS in 5 or 6 months time after being an analyst for 2 years (I started when I was 20) and it's all you guys, so, thanks. 

Edit: here's everything:

I started when I was 18 years old, in something that I never knew it would be my gate to this job: a sales agent. Been so for a whole year. This gave me a lot of business context, how a manager leads people under him, and how his manager looks at his performance and understood something about the hierarchical behavior of companies. 
Then, I left the job after a year, now it's the pandemic, I spent it leqrning Excel and basic statistics, all on YouTube.

Moving forward to when I was 20, I had no idea a data analyst is even a title, and got a job as an accountant at a small workshop, with college going on, and I was studying business administration and statistics.
The job was never an accountant or have anything to do with accounting, my manager at the time was a very smart guy, working with pen and paper as his ledger, then I introduced Excel, he was all in for it, I started creating tables for our sales and inventory and customers and places we work in.

He started asking questions, you said last month we made 40K, how come we make 45 this month? I started digging into our data unknowingly doing analysis.

His brother was a regular visitor, I learned that he is the head of data at a big startup in our country, saw what I did, kept giving me tasks and I answer with Excel.

Then, he gave me a course that I highly recommend about Excel: power tools in Excel, you can find sources on YouTube for it a lot (power query, power pivot and data modeling). I started applying DAX, and here comes my first book [Dax Guide](https://www.google.com.eg/books/edition/_/dtr8oQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQo4eZ8OKEAxUXgP0HHXfgDTIQ7_IDKAB6BAgPEAM).

Then I started my LinkedIn journey, showing Excel and powerBI dashboards and applying to jobs, in data analysis, really that's all you need, business context, some technical tools to help you dig into the data and answer questions.

Then, I started reading about data science, how statistics is important and how much I liked it in college, here goes the second book, [Naked Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data-ebook/dp/B007Q6XLF2).
Here I learned to think with stats a bit.

Then, I found that I lack implementation to a lot of concepts to statistics, people recommended python for me, here there were two sources for me to learn from, YouTube courses got me up and running into how to write simple code in python and understand the syntax.

Later, DataCamp had tracks, I finished the Data Analyst with python and another one data analyst with SQL. This helped me BIG time in knowing where to go next. 

Note: I was doing all of that while working and being in college.

The DataCamp course had great courses about statistics and probability and simulation. While also practicing SQL, I got really good with it.

Now, got a job as a junior sales ops analyst (my role now). I got lucky, working on real problems and practicing what I learn.

Then started moving back to books, but I lacked problem solving mindset, read these books: [Stop Guessing](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Guessing-Behaviors-Problem-Solvers/dp/162656986X) and[Lean Analytics](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

This helped me big time understand how my work affects the company. 

Now it's time to show your work to stakeholders, I read this book: [Storytelling with data](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

It's time to go back to the details of my job, It was all querying on metabase, an open source BI tool.

I was responsible for giving agents retailers to visit, so, Every morning, we are supposed to apply filters on our data (last order date, last visit date and some other features ) and tell the agent, visit 20 of those retailers and go home. I was doing all of that in an automated fashion with power query, creating automated pipelines was my passion in Excel. All I had to do was give it an updated file from our database, refresh the pipeline, take the new file, dump it into our system.

They do visit 20 retailers, but the problem reached the tech team, the data was too much to handle, requiring us to give a smaller set of retailers for the agents, specifically 40 retailers.

But how do we guarantee they are close to each other? Here come my first interaction with adata scientist.

I did all what I did in Excel but in python using pandas and then reached the point where I don't know how to give clusters.

He took my jupyter notebook, gave it to us back with the solution to our problem, with something I was not familiar with at the time, Kmeans constrained.
Which took only longitude, latitude gave each agent his route of 40 retailers.

I started taking notes from his improvements to my code and asked him, what did you do?

He told my my code was fine, but you used a lot of custom functions on operations that can be vectorized, I asked for a book recommendation about vectorized operations in pandas here, the guys recommended this [Data Wrangling in python book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Tools-Easier/dp/1491948817).

After that book, I was obsessed with data automation in python using pandas and numpy only.

I got also obsessed with vectorizing any operation in our code base, read something pandas specific now: [Effective Pandas](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).

Then, it was the part where he interacted with our system API.

Since all our company data scientists and swes have access to snowflake and live databases, we, analysts, had access to only metabase.

I saw this as an opportunity to get known!

I wrote two functions used by our entire company, ret_metabase and interact_with_google_sheets
The first one connects to the API endpoint and then takes your credintials and the makes a session ID and gets your card ID string response in json and I convert it to a dataframe. The second requires an Api key, thenenables tge user to do anything with a google sheet, remove data set with a dataframe get data asa dataframe append on data filter views really anything in one function.
How did I learn to do all of that? A course on youtube , just type API development in python amd a book about data structures, [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM). This helped big time in optimizing my code performance and writing cleaner code.

I got known and these functions are in the companies library now and people use it all the time. And I even left funny comments in the documentation and Everything.

The kmeans thing got me really interested in machine learning and here's the first book you guys recommended: [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/).

It was really hard for me at first because I had not been introduced properly to those three topics:
1- linear algebra
2- calculus
3- probability and statistics
I took [Jon Krohn's live lessions](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations) it's free on YouTube.

But those three were later taken (started linear algebra in November 23).

So I struggled back then and here, another book was suggested: Hands-on ML.

I finished it and was really fucking hyped to apply the stuff I learned directly into my job, even without my manager permissions.

But that was not enough, I did not know what I should do to impact our compqny, what is data science?

I read this book: [Data science with business, what you need to know about DS](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323)

First thing I dod after understanding what kmeans is, improved our routes clustering function by standerdizing the scales of the long, lat, giving it another column ( retailer rank) that rankstarts at the maximum value the longitude and decays linearly from 31 to 30 (longitude here is from 30 to 31), I used linspace and select in numpy here to give retailers ranks. This rank was business objective (give 31 toretailers with high conversion and then 30.9 to retailers with monotonically decreasing nmv to make them order back and so on...) Any other retailer takes a zero in his face. This helped in giving optimized distance to retailers we really need to visit.

This gave us a big boost in agents strike rate and overall performance.

Second, I applied xgboost, predicting who will place an order today if visited. Gave them the biggest rank.

Testing this was a must, so I learned about A/B testing, and some other great bootstrapping ideas here [Practical Statistics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) Book.

This pushed our strike rate from 40 to 73%.

Then, I really now see that I lack probability knowledge and maths knowledge to be a data scientist, so I read [Essential maths for DS](https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098102932).

Since my job was about sales operations, it was a necessary thing to automate discovering new sales areas and opportunity, previously, we used to draw polygons in areas we want to open, and then the agents are set there to wander and find retailers on their own.

I got an idea, how about I get all streets know in this area and make blocks in the intersections and then convert the coords to google maps link and give 50 daily sequential links to agents to discover areas in a more naturally sequential way? I used omnix API to get streets data and geopandas to make all other operations, I learned how to work with geopandas from their docs, really straightforward.

This project was big, applied everything I know about pandas and data structures and business knowledge to do it, and it's up and running now.

I got praised for it and the head of data was impressed with the result and decided to give me access to snowflake directly to limit requests on metabase as the data was big and then I scaled the project to all regions we operate in.

Then it was time to speak with the senior ds lead.

I showed him all I wrote here, he recommended I get a strong foundation in linear algebra and calculus and probability.

I got it, and now working on probability and statistics.

I then told him I am really into causal inference (rwcommended by someone in my previous post here) and regression analysis.

He said that's exactly what they need from the junior they want to hire, ""anyone can fit and predict nowdays"" he said, ""we need someone who can make an impact in all the stuff we don't have time for and teach him more cloud tools and maybe he gives us new ideas or show us new tools"" he elaborated.

Right now I am studying probability and statistics and then will study [Causal Inference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/causal-inference-in/9781098140243/).


I guess that's all, the most important thing is that you keep studying and never giving up, please, focus more on business context as it's overlooked.

PSA: You don't need fancy stuff to do good work.,13cpckb,"I've been reading a lot of posts on r/datascience and several seem to orbit the subject of how to use the latest tool or tweak, I understand that it can be easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of tools, frameworks, and cutting-edge technologies. While these advancements can undoubtedly enhance our work, it's important to remember that data science isn't about using the most advanced or expensive tools; it's about extracting valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.

Data Collection and Categorization

Before diving into advanced machine learning algorithms or statistical models, we need to start with the basics: collecting and organizing data. Fortunately, both Python and R offer a wealth of libraries that make it easy to collect data from a variety of sources, including web scraping, APIs, and reading from files. Key libraries in Python include [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), while R has [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html), [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

These libraries not only make it easy to collect data but also to clean and structure it for analysis. With just a few lines of code, you can filter, sort, and transform data into a format that's ready for exploration and modeling.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Once your data is collected and organized, the next step is to analyze and visualize it. Both Python and R excel in this area, providing a wide range of libraries and packages for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Python's pandas, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) libraries offer powerful functionality for data manipulation, while [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/) provide versatile tools for creating visualizations. Similarly, in R, you can use dplyr, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) for data manipulation, and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html), and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for visualization. These packages enable you to create insightful visualizations and perform statistical analyses without relying on expensive or proprietary software.

Modeling and Prediction

Finally, when it comes to building models and making predictions, Python and R have a plethora of options available. Libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)in Python, or [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/), [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf), and [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)in R, provide powerful machine learning algorithms and statistical models that can be applied to a wide range of problems. What's more, these libraries are open-source and have extensive documentation and community support, making it easy to learn and apply new techniques without needing specialized training or expensive software licenses.

Simplicity is key, embrace it and you'll learn a lot faster than trying to glean insights from some poorly trained AI model.

"Data Science Masters - The Good, the Bad, The Ugly",leh0ve,"TL;DR Edit, because I'm seeing a few comments taking this in a bit of a binary way...the program is valuable and interesting and I don't regret doing it per se, AND there are parts which are needlessly frustrating and unacceptable for a degree that's existed for this long from as ostensibly prestigious a university; don't completely scratch all your higher-ed plans, but please be an informed and prepared buyer of your own education. 

Hi all. I'm a FAANG data engineer, former analyst (yes: I escaped the Analyst Trap, if not in the direction I thought/hoped I was going to, yet) and current student in the UC Berkeley Masters of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program. I thought I'd do a little write up since I frequently see people asking about the pros and cons of these kind of programs. This is my personal experience (though definitely found other students share more than just a few of these experiences) so take with the customary salt grain.

The Good: The instructors are generally pretty good at explaining concepts, office hours are helpful, and projects are frequently relevant to what you \*might\* be doing on the job - or in a lab. The available courseload runs the gamut from serious statistics & causal inference (which you might...want to know if you ever plan on running an A/B test, much less a clinical trial) to machine learning *as implemented via distributed computing*/*in the cloud*, which is probably more realistic and practical in some cases than building yourself a whole model on your, I don't know, lenovo work laptop. There's an NLP course that gets good (if shell-shocked) reviews. Lots of decent people. Career services is actually quite helpful when they can be. Your student success advisor is almost certainly a damn saint; while they can't wave a magic wand to solve your problems, they will try to get you resources and advice you may need. Be nice to them.

The Bad: Berkeley...doesn't know how to run a smooth online data science class, evidently. The logistics are often messy. I've seen issues with git repos that arbitrarily prevented downloading necessary materials, major assumptions made on assignments about students prior experience (not like ""you've taken some math before"" - like ""you know how to do bash scripting,"" which is something that, more reasonably, a large % of people might genuinely have never really touched). Recordings of office hours that...don't show the screenshare, leaving you to *guess* at what's going on & follow along just by listening. Errors/typos in homework assignments as given. At one point we were running an experiment and promised up to $500 reimbursement - I paid OOP and then, as it turns out, reimbursement takes *into the next semester.* The instructor didn't even *know* when it would happen, or how, when I asked - so weeks, and weeks, of waiting to be reimbursed for a good half a k, with no good communication or clarity. Instructors are sometimes handed a class with built out materials & not prepared or provided any real familiarization with the materials as extant. In the course I am in now, there is someone dedicated to helping out w infrastructure...who has exactly 1 OH a week, which happens to be (mostly) *during an actual section,* with the aforementioned recording problem so heaven help you if you miss one and it's a time-sensitive issue that, for instance, is blocking your homework. I've seen at least 1 case where we were supposed to have 2wks to work on an assignment. Instructors forgot to upload the data needed for the HW until half a week after my section and didn't change the due date, meaning the weekend section(s) had the full two weeks, de facto, while we had less. I had to *ask* for the due date to be moved back, and even then *they didn't actually give our section the full time.* And dragged their feet making any decision about it at all. So...directly advantaging one or sections over others? Fun!

In general, the subject matter is fascinating and well-explained - when you get a chance to ask - and *most* of the classes I've taken have been fun, interesting, rewarding, and relevant - not always to my job right *now*, but certainly to \* some permutation\* of the broader data science role. It's definitely an intro - you're not gonna graduate from a 2yr degree as an objective expert in such a complex field - but it goes a hell of a lot deeper and touches on more relevant stuff than your average non-degree program would, I think. With that said, It can feel as if you're (expected to be) learning IT 202 on top of data science - which is a fine and important subject, but my attitude is it is 100% not what I paid for and not my job to be the unpaid Quality Assurance staff on the ""Online Masters"" Project, and this represents a profound failure of the school administration and, sadly, some of the instructors to treat their students fairly. It remains to be seen whether the whole masters is ""worth it"" - but I can honestly say that this semester and one of the others really are/were not, in my opinion, worth what I paid for them. At 8000+ dollars a class, *the school and/or the instructor better get it right.* And fix it if it's going wrong. So far, they...don't. My advisor is great, and highly sympathetic. But I haven't really seen any effort by the school administration or instructors to better the experience. As with most higher education, let the buyer beware: your experience will be more rewarding the more you expect and assume to be walking into a mess - but sadly, if you don't have enough time to start every assignment abominably early so you can ask every possible question / resolve any possible issue, make all the office hours you could possibly need to, and find the perfect group of study buddies, you're going to have some rough semesters.

&#x200B;

Not exactly dropping out of the degree, and I do feel it's ultimately valuable, but it's certainly dragging on a bit, and becoming more a game of ""how do I best compensate for the lack of communication, poor communication, and unacceptably disorganized infrastructure that I am almost certainly going to have to deal with"" than ""how do I learn this challenging and complex concept.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/leh0ve/data_science_masters_the_good_the_bad_the_ugly/,TheBankTank,371,Education,212,Top - all

Every Kaggle Competition Submission is a carbon copy of each other -- is Kaggle even relevant for non-beginners?,gh3v0q,"When I was first learning Data Science a while back, I was mesmerized by Kaggle (the competition) as a polished platform for self-education. I was able to learn how to do complex visualizations, statistical correlations, and model tuning on a slew of different kinds of data.

But after working as a Data Scientist in industry for few years, I now find the platform to be shockingly basic, and every submission a carbon copy of one another. They all follow the same, unimaginative, and repetitive structure; first import the modules (and write a section on how you imported the modules), then do basic EDA (pd.scatter\_matrix...), next do even more basic statistical correlation (df.corr()...) and finally write few lines for training and tuning multiple algorithms. Copy and paste this format for every competition you enter, no matter the data or task at hand. It's basically what you do for every take homes.

The reason why this happens is because so much of the actual data science workflow is controlled and simplified. For instance, every target variable for a supervised learning competition is given to you. In real life scenarios, that's never the case. In fact, I find target variable creation to be extremely complex, since it's technically and conceptually difficult to define things like churn, upsell, conversion, new user, etc.

But is this just me? For experienced ML/DS practitioners in industry, do you find Kaggle remotely helpful? I wanted to get some inspiration for some ML project I wanted to do on customer retention for my company, and I was led completely dismayed by the lack of complexity and richness of thought in Kaggle submissions. The only thing I found helpful was doing some fancy visualization tricks through plotly.

Does anyone else feel Python is immensely more difficult than R?,po9qpo,"So I've been doing this for about 7 years now + a couple years of screwing around in grad school. At the same time, somehow I've just been able to stay primarily in R all these years. It's suboptimal, but I've never made an effort to transition to Python. I'm also bad in terms of best practices and staying on top of new developments. So that should be kept in mind.

Caveats out of the way... am I the only one who finds Python massively more difficult to use? I'm the only member of the DS team at my company at the moment and we just had someone leave who was primarily in Python. Some of his code broke and now I'm having to troubleshoot it. I can't make heads or tails. With my R code things are basically sequential and you can tell what's happening by searching object names and following changes to those objects. Whenever I look at my colleagues' python code it rarely resembles that. And it's cumbersome to run pieces of code and see where it's breaking. In R I can easily run this piece, then the next piece, then look inside constituent functions.

I've also never seen anything in my colleagues' code that resembles tidyverse. I'm ridiculously more efficient in data munging than I was in base R. Most of my data comes from the wild and cleaning data seems like a nightmare in Python. It could just be a skillset thing, but my when my Python colleagues would be responsible for cleaning data I would regularly find some troubling errors. I can't help but think it may have to do with the tool they're using.

My other gripe is environments. My old boss had some great projects, but the shit rarely runs for me. I spend a huge amount of time trying to set up the appropriate environments.

A more constructive question is how can I get my hands around this? Any time I sit down to learn Python I spend a lot of time on minor concepts that I would likely pick up anyway. After a few weeks I'm so bored that when other things come up I just drop it. The way I learned R involved adapting other people's code and understanding how it works. I'd pick apart something advanced and figure out simpler concepts as a part of that process. I have a ton of Python code available to me that's relevant to my job but I can't get it to run at all, much less truly understand it and build my own version.

Open COVID-19 Dataset,fieuqo,"I was frustrated with the maintenance issues in the dataset maintained by [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) so I created an alternative crowd-sourced dataset here: https://github.com/open-covid-19/data

If anyone knows of any better datasets, please point them out! worldometers.info appears to have pretty good data but I can't find how to get it for my own analysis.

Thoughts on The Social Dilemma?,j97s27,"There's a recently released Netflix documentary called ""The Social Dilemma"" that's been going somewhat viral and has made it's way into Netflix's list of trending videos.

The documentary is more or less an attack on social media platforms (mostly Facebook) and how they've steadily been contributing to tearing apart society for the better part of the last decade. There's interviews with a number of former top executives from Facebook, Twitter, Google, Pinterest (to name a few) and they explain how sites have used algorithms and AI to increase users' engagement, screen time, and addiction (and therefore profits), while leading to unintended negative consequences (the rise of confirmation bias, fake news, cyber bullying, etc). There's a lot of great information presented, none of which is that surprising for data scientists or those who have done even a little bit of research on social media.

In a way, it painted the practice of data science in a negative light, or at least how social media is unregulated (which I do agree it should be).

"Don't sweat the interview, come back stronger",tb2gi0,"I recently had my first interview with a serious Data Science position. I am a data analyst with lots of side work in machine learning, but not much in actual industry experience. Here are some of the interview questions/asks:

* Tell us about your work history.
* Give an example of the insights provided for (said) project.
* Name an example of a challenge you had and how did you solve it.
* Name an example of an accomplishment and how you achieved it.
* Any questions for us?

In answering these questions, I was not specific enough. I had results and I had experience that would make me good at this job. I am the lead researcher in my job, but I failed to communicate this to them. I was extremely bummed as this would be the first real 'data science' job I've had with a pay to back it up. But on the bright side, this has made me think about the interview process.

I agree with their decision, as hard as it is to admit. Why do I deserve a 6-figure salary if I can't give them clear, concise explanations as to how I benefit my current company?

 My takeaway is this:

1. Write out all your most influential experience, job projects, and personal projects
2. Follow a What, why, how approach. What did you do, why did you do it, and how did you do it.
3. Speak less, let them ask questions, and also, know that the ""soft"" questions are actually questions meant to derive a technical response.

"As a data scientist, what is your most proud contribution to your team or company?",xypfy4,"Hi,

I was reading [Professional data scientists what are the algorithms and models that you actually end up using the most?](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xvhiml/professional_data_scientists_what_are_the/).

I am surprised because, for almost any method below, a bachelor's degree in economics or statistics is sufficient. Maybe, we should include Gradient Boosting and Random Forest to the list, but they are not very challenging as well.

>Out of 188 comments thus far there are:

Hence, I become curious about what people's most proud contributions to their team or company.

Note: I am aware that using more complex techniques does not necessarily imply producing more fruitful results. However, the techniques mentioned above are still far away from people's expectations regarding being a data scientist. Thus, I am still curious about the most significant contributions, and how much people satisfied with them.

Edit: Mine was proposing a new solution to a highly complex classification problem. Proved that the proposed method has higher accuracy using bootstrap and t-test. Designed a production-level architecture to implement the new solution. Introduced the bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Accuracy rose from 70ish percent to 95+.

Quick tip on asking the right questions during an interview,v4529a,"I used to view asking questions during an interview as just a formality. 

I was completely wrong. 

Spending the time to ask great questions will:

1. Make you stand out because everyone else asks generic questions (if at all – some don’t ask any)
2. Tell you what you REALLY want to know about the company and role
3. Reveal what they’re looking for in their ideal candidate (which is info you can use in later rounds..)

So how do you ask the right questions? Just remember one thing:

Vague questions lead to vague answers. So make your questions s*pecific*. 

A simple way to do this is to ask questions about the past:

“How do you handle disagreements?” => “How did you handle a disagreement recently?”

“How do you balance using data vs intuition?” => “When did you last use intuition to make a decision?”

I made a table to help you frame your questions in a more effective manner:

|What I Want To Know|What I ask|
|:-|:-|
|What problems does the organization have?|What are the top 2 things you hope to improve in your org over the next 6 months?|
|What is working well in their opinion?|What are you really proud of?|
|What do they really expect from the advertised role? (i.e expectations)|What are the top two most impactful things I can achieve in the next 6-12 months?|
|Why do you want me (as a person) to join?|What from my resume or experience do you think is immediately valuable to the company?|
|Why did the last person leave?|What are the top two areas of improvement for the last person? What were their top strengths?|
|What's the work life balance like?|How often do you or another data scientist have to stay in late?|

What are your favorite questions to ask to your interviewer?

Let me know in the comments :)

It’s only been 3 days and I feel so out of my depth. The founders and CTO are referring to this project as a ‘trial by fire’ and I am terrified. 

Sure the project is do-able, but I’m a fresh grad, junior data scientist and don’t feel like a project of this scale and importance should be given to a junior. Or maybe it should and I’m going crazy.

How to explain to Management that Data Cleaning is a really important part of my job,ngls7t,"Hi all,

I recently started my first job working as an entry level Data Scientist. I’ve been working at this company for roughly 3.5 months now and was put on a project where I am to extract phrases and classification codes from PDF documents in different languages (there is more to it than that - I’m just keeping it brief without disclosing too much).

I had relatively finished most of the algorithm that is able to extract and compile these phrases/codes - however, the dataset that I am using has all been entered manually by multiple different people who work at the company (~100+ people). This requires a lot of data cleaning to process duplicate phrases that are mapped to different codes, categories of codes, etc. Additionally, it appears that many people have formatted their inputs drastically differently. I am currently only doing this for the English language and then will have to do it for French, Spanish, and German in the coming weeks. Each dataset is initially 250,000 records where I can automate roughly 90% of the cleaning - the rest are all either really obscure cases or the classification of the duplicate phrases are too close to call causing me to have to closely examine and google them online to determine which one shouldn’t be there. 

I know all of this is all super vague - I am trying my best to explain what I can share (some things I can’t)

Back to my question - I have weekly meetings with management where some of them seem surprised when I tell them that I am still working on data cleaning (been working on it for 2 weeks now and will likely need more time than this as I haven’t even finished the English dataset). I would estimate that up to this point 70%-75% of the code I’ve written is for the sole purpose of data cleaning, preprocessing, and determining what belongs where (using fuzzy logic and embeddings). My question is how do I explain to them that the data cleaning process is most of the work a data scientist needs to do? Am I looking into this too much? Had I been given a perfectly clean dataset, I would be able to complete this in no time. Also, this is my first job out of college (bachelors degree in Data Science) and I definitely acknowledge the skill gap between me and the other members on my team who are Sr. Data Scientists. They are much more efficient than I am when it comes to things such as Deep Learning, the cloud, etc. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated



TL;DR My first job out of college. Been working at the company for 3.5 months as a data scientist. Management seems to be surprised that data cleaning is taking me so long (2 weeks and counting) to complete which makes me feel like I am not working efficiently enough. Does management have it backwards where they think building the ML models is more intense than the Data Cleaning portion?


Edit: Thank you all for the input and advice! I have a meeting with management later this week and I will definitely be using the suggestions and advice provided here

Edit 2: Wow!! I really can thank everyone enough for all the advice and feedback I received. You all have gave me some great guidance as to how I can navigate this issue. Thank you!

I have mostly been a lurker in this subreddit, reading the tips, hacks, and suggestions members meticulously draft. In my journey from Chemical Engineering focused Ph.D. to Data Science and ML application, this subreddit has been vital. During my job search and interview prep the cheat sheets and tips shared by everyone in this subreddit were helpful resources, beyond that I felt I was not alone in this journey with users sharing their career insights, up & downs. As I finally look towards beginning a new phase in my life, a big thank you to everyone in this subreddit, the selfless writers, didactic bloggers, and well-wishers, I owe a part of my success to you all.

Edit 1: Chemical Engineering PhD at a university in the midwest. I was able to start a DS-focused project which later had a strong ML component and had an industry internship last summer (2020). However, during my job search, I realized the research I do doesn't translate well to industry and there are no open positions in the roles that might align well. I took some supplementary courses (Coursera & Datacamp), set up a portfolio website, and widened my network. The tips and anecdotes shared in this subreddit were a crucial source of motivation and support.

Edit 2: I am an international student on an F1 so I had to factor in time taken to get my work permit and willingness of the employer to sponsor my eventual work visa. The average time to get a work permit is 180 days which brought in another constraint.

New role: My new job is focused on drug discovery modeling at a pharma company.

"Why arguing about who is a ""Real Data Scientist"" is a misguided exercise",bezjso,"One of the most common arguments these days revolves around what constitutes a ""real"" Data Scientist, and by proxy, who is deserving of the Data Scientist title. A popular opinion is that Data Scientists need to do machine learning or they're not real data scientists.

I think this completely misses the point of job titles: job titles are not meant to define a role. Job titles are meant to be corporate abbreviations for job descriptions. It is job descriptions that are matched against outside salary references, and it is job descriptions that are graded for pay purposes. Job descriptions are used for hiring purposes and ultimately job descriptions describe the job that you do.

There are some professions where titles have very real meanings (Lawyers who pass the bar exam, Professional Engineers who pass the P.E. exam, Accountants who are certified CPAs, etc.), but the majority of titles don't mean anything, and Data Scientist is certainly in that camp.

Other examples:

- At a lot of large corporation, you see Sr. Managers that don't manage anyone (i.e., have no direct reports).

- Every person in national/executive sales is a VP, even though they are not responsible for a P&L and often don't even have direct reports. Oh, and they make less money than a Director in every other branch of the company.

- Every bank title is incredibly inflated (again, TONS of VPs)

- Every quant/trading title is incredibly deflated - they'll seemingly call someone an analyst their whole lives even if they're making 400k and have 15 years experience.

The only constraints on job titles are often internal, and a consequence of how they fit relative to existing internal job descriptions. Specifically, if a specific job title term (e.g., Engineer, Analyst, Consultant) has traditionally been associated with a certain set of skills and responsibilities, a new role that has completely new requirements should in general avoid using the same title.

So why are so many companies giving Data Science titles to people who don't do Machine Learning given that the original data scientists had to? Here is what the life-cycle of creating a role looks like *at a company that doesn't have existing data science capabilities*:

1) Hiring manager decides she needs a new person with a profile that doesn't exist in the form of an existing job description. She needs this person to do mostly analysis, but she also needs them to be able to write code in Python to automate some processes, build the occasional model (likely not a production model), and access back-end databases directly and often. She may also, in time, need this person to dedicate more time to building more advanced statistical models, maybe even ML models, but as of right now that is highly uncertain because the company has never used ML in the past.

2) After writing this job description, the key hitting points look something like this: 

* Must have 2+ years experience with R/Python
* Must have 2+ years experience with SQL
* Must have experience building statistical models.
* A whole bunch of business and soft skills stuff

3) HR receives this job description and they now need to grade it. Since they have Analyst/Sr Analyst roles already, they compare the job description against those roles. They quickly find that none of those job descriptions require R/Python, SQL or building models. But they do match a lot of the other requirements, so it becomes clear that they will need a different type of role that is both different (includes Python/SQL/Modeling) and higher (more requirements) than the existing Analyst/Sr. Analyst roles. They may have even higher levels of Analyst (Lead, Principal), but none of them will require the use of Python/SQL/Modeling, so the fact of the matter is that they are going to need to get away from the Analyst title or otherwise create confusion and internal inconsistencies.

4) In order to do their benchmarking, HR pulls salaries and comp from an external data source that helps them match job description requirements to those posted by other companies. They work their way through putting the job description requirements into the system, and the system tells HR what jobs with similar JDs pay, including a range. It also tells this person the titles of the people who have similar JDs - which will likely include jobs that are legitimate Data Science jobs as they require R, Python, SQL, and statistical modeling experience. But it also will include some Analyst roles that do require programming skills (maybe some quant roles), and other random role titles that no one would think of looking into. All in all, the job grade that comes back is higher than an Analyst role (because of the added skills), but not quite as high as that of the first-gen Data Scientists, i.e., Ph.D. + 5 years experience in Silicon Valley. 

5) Now they need a job title. They know they can't name the role ""Analyst"" or ""Sr. Analyst"" because the skill set (and job grading) is different. Therefore they want to avoid having one ""Analyst"" making considerably more money than the rest of the Analysts, and also would like to make it clear that current Analysts may not have the skillset needed for this new role. They may, but it cannot be assumed by default that they do. They currently don't have any data scientists, so there's no toes to step on there, so it becomes a natural solution to name this new role ""Data Scientist"". Why that and not a completely new title to avoid clashing with the existing Data Scientist roles that are more senior in the marketplace?

* **You want a title that can be easily found by people with the right skillset**: because the candidate you are looking for has some characteristics of an old school data scientist and some of an analyst, you want to hit with a title that will catch the high-end of the pool you're looking for. ""Analyst"" may leave some of those people out. 

* **You want the role to be easy to find**: you can title the job ""Programming Friendly Analyst"", but it would just make it harder to get it to show up on searches. Meanwhile, because people are searching for the Data Scientist role often, it gives you better visibility. 

And there you have it, you now have a Data Scientist opening that you can post. Odds are you will get a wide range of candidates applying, including some who will be greatly overqualified (but will inquire because of the Data Science title being so variable), but you will end up hiring someone who is, ideally, at the top end of your requirements.

More importantly, as more and more companies do this, the general convergence is not based on original data science roles, but rather the new data science roles that are going to be more common because they will fill a need in a much larger market (i.e., more companies need people to tame their data and run basic modeling, fewer companies are ready for cutting edge ML).

You will certainly have organizations where step 5 is different, i.e., where the ""Analyst"" roles already have programming requirements (quants, consulting are all great examples), and in that case it makes sense that Data Scientist will be defined as ""can do ML"", because the only reason to create a new role will be to differentiate people who can do analysis, modeling, and programming from those who can do all of those things AND build machine learning models.

And then you have the even more extreme examples, FANGs, where you are seeing the creation of roles that are even more technical than Data Scientist (like Applied Scientist and Research Scientist and ML Engineer), which - again - were likely required to create internal differentiation between people who can execute machine learning models vs. people who can develop brand new machine learning concepts/scale machine learning to solve massively complex applications/etc.

On to my last point: to those who are on the cutting edge of machine learning and AI knowledge who feel ""icky"" getting lumped in with us simpletons who are just running fancy regression models to make our companies more money - just know that the reason your salaries are continuing to increase is because the number of companies hiring Data people like myself to solve simpleton problems is blowing up the market, and creating a scarcity everywhere in the field that is driving salaries up. So, while I understand that you like the prestige of having a title that reflects just how much more about machine learning you know that the rest of us, please appreciate that the popularity of the general field of Decision Science has greatly benefited you directly.

**TL;DR: No one company/group of people get to dictate what is/isn't a ""Data Scientist"". It is a natural response of the market to allow those companies looking for employees to find the right job seekers while satisfying internal corporate constraints. To continue to argue about who is/isn't a data scientist is pointless, because the title itself actually doesn't mean anything. Most importantly, a rising tide lifts all boats, and we have all benefited from the demand for all types of data scientists.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bezjso/why_arguing_about_who_is_a_real_data_scientist_is/,dfphd,345,,75,Top - all

I hire data scientists - this is the stuff this forum doesn't discuss enough...:,3m78k1,"Hi,

I put a post up a week or so ago about how I hire some junior data scientists - I was actually struggling because I usually hire more senior positions. 
&nbsp;

I got some *great* feedback - and thank you to everyone who commented. At the time though, I put up a comment saying that I felt that this subreddit, and others like the ML one, while great at covering SOME of the area's in data science, left gaps in other area's that really matter in real world scenarios.  I said I would write something about it.
&nbsp;


I wrote an obscenely long post about it, and then it didn't post properly (operator error). So, rather than re-type that essay, I thought I would do something at a higher level and then answer questions.
&nbsp;


Lets set some context first.
I work in private industry - a big(ish) UK financial services company. I do a mix of internal R&D type work - stuff our own teams ask for - and stuff that clients ask for. So - everything that follows is in that context - it is a bit different if your working for a start up company. It is very different if your working in acedemia. It's very different if your working for government agencies. Keep that in mind.
&nbsp;


I think this forum is awesome - I lurk every day. However, there is stuff that makes up the majority of my life and my guys life that doesn't get discussed here which - as there are so many people posting about moving into this world, and looking for jobs in this world - I think is an issue.
&nbsp;


Here are some things which I think need to be discussed here more. Also - if you can show me this stuff on a CV or in an interview, it will jump you straight to the top of the pile. 
&nbsp;



**1) You are ridiculously expensive - show me how you will add value.**
There is a team in every private company that all other departments fear and dread. They are called ""Finance"" and they are the bane of every managers life. They apply basic mathematics in bizarre ways, and they will constantly demand that managers either spend more or less money than they are. The managers will NEVER win.
&nbsp;



When it comes to head count it boils down to profit margin. Lets say I am recruiting for a senior data scientist and will pay then $100,000 ( really - thats a bit on the low side, but it makes a simple calculation). Lets say my company runs at a 20% profit margin. In the world of Finance, this means that that person needs to add $500,000 of value- not $100,000 -  before they break even. You may think this is crazy - but that is because you are a mere mortal and do not know Finance Maths. You don't have to agree with it - you just have to live with it.
&nbsp;



What does that mean for you the data guy? You need to **Get Stuff Done**. You probably aren't going to be getting your own sales leads and doing your own deals - but you need to add value. And that really means ***BEING PRAGMATIC***
&nbsp;



Some work needs to be *absolutely* perfect. These are the places where you spend the extra week tweaking your model for that last .1% of accuracy. It's where you are expected to go read papers to find a new clustering algorithm that will reduce the over-fit by .5% and you get a month to try it and deal with it.
&nbsp;



But - a lot of stuff doesn't need perfection. If you need to join two sets of data as a one off task, then it doesn't matter if you use SAS, a lump of PERL, bookmarks in TextPad, Excel, Python. No one cares - you just need to get it done. If you need to know whether two elements of data correlate, then often a basic regression is ""good enough"", and will save you a couple of hours.
&nbsp;



*What does this mean?*
You'll know which hat you need to wear - but when you're wearing your ""just get it done"" hat - which will be more often than your ""Get it perfect"" hat - you need to a toolbag full of quick work arounds and practical methods. If something takes 100 lines of SAS, 10 lines of Python or 2 lines of Perl... don't go the SAS route. If you need to eyeball and juggle 10,000 records then you could drop it out as a set of tables with R, or you could do it in Excel. I know it's not cool - but finance don't care - so your manager doesn't - so you don't. Get good at this stuff. Be pragmatic. Know when to have a ""Good enough"" mentality. And show it.....
&nbsp;



**2) Learn to deal with junk**
Real world data is, usually, rubbish. You need to be *REALLY* good at dealing with rubbish.
Examples - I have about 2 petabytes of data coming from about 8,000 sources. The absolute best raw data set has a 2% error rate. The worst has a 75% error rate. Those figures are better than a lot of other groups are dealing with. You don't get to complain or get someone else to clean it up - you need to be good at adapting to it. REALLY REALLY REALLY good.
&nbsp;


That data comes in to me in perhaps 1500 schemas and formats. No provider - ever - sticks to a schema. EVER. *EVER!* So, I need to be able to join data that arrived in EBSDIC to stuff that turns up in weirdly compressed AVRO. (tip here - learn to love CSV - it's a perfect intermediate - as is an SQLite table). Looking across my data sets, I can see a minimum of 21 different data structures for Date:Time. What ever your going to do, your going to use dates and times. So - thats something you need to be slick with. Remember Point 1) - this is ""Get It Done"" stuff. 
&nbsp;


Also - a lot of data science is speculative - your going to have 10 idea's for every 1 actual piece of solid work you do. For those idea's, you're usually going to need to crash a data sample together, give it an eyeballing, patch it up a bit, do some basic work and see if it's practical. That means 9 out of 10 of those tasks you do will be disposable - so just Get It Done.
&nbsp;


All of this is probably best described as ""Data Monkeying"" - your not doing science - your monkeying with data. Realistically over the course of a year, you will probably spend 50% of your time doing Data Monkey work rather than real Data Science. 
&nbsp;


*What does that mean?*
When i recruit a data scientist, they absolutely, completely and totally MUST be damn good data monkeys. I'm counting on you being able to do the data monkeying in 50% of your day, not 90% of your day, so that the other 50% of your day you can do the ""Data Science"" bit and actually add value - cos the Finance Team are watching...
&nbsp;


It's not cool, you don't get a conference speech out of it, and it doesn't get you a bonus, but unless you are dealing with a single source of data, a good deal of your life is going to be spent dealing with this mess. You need to 1) get good at it and 2) not take too long dealing with it.
&nbsp;


If I had god like powers over this Sub I would make it so that 50% or more of the posts are people trading tips, cookbooks, idea's and lots of practice data sets so they are getting good at data monkeying, rather than Data Science. Definitely less cool - but will make the biggest impact to your working lives.
&nbsp;


Some examples of data monkeying: Flicking between data structures and schemas. Recasting data. parsing data. Changing time series - compressing and interpolation of time events -Spliting data. Joining data. Dealing with common types of tricky data - like names, address structures, dates, time series. blah blah blah.
&nbsp;


Fastest way to get your CV to the top of the pile - make sure that I can see your data monkeying as well as your data science skills.
&nbsp;


**3) Learn to tell a story and not be scary.**
Your going to work with all sorts of people - Sales, IT, Operations and lots of managers. And you will intimidate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. Whether you are or not actually scary, when you walk into a room, they will automatically assume that you are the brightest person in that room and that your going to baffle them. 
&nbsp;


Some people - a minority - will try and get close to you and learn from you. The vast majority will react to their intimidation by either not listening to you at all ( many managers ) or feeling annoyed by you ( most sales people). It's not anyone's fault - it's just human nature. If you break out the big words, the jargon, the acronyms and present them with a 19 page excel spreadsheet you do nothing but reinforce those pre-conceptions. Downside for you is that it's harder to rapidly climb the career ladder. Downside for your boss is that it's harder for you to show 5x or 20x your salary as value - which means more discussions with Finance ( shudder)
&nbsp;



*Two easy fixes and one sneaky fix:*
**Fix 1** - Learn to tell a story. Seriously - when you tell people about your work give it a beginning, a middle and an end. ""I was asked X, I did A, B, C and D, it looks like the answer is Y"". You might not need to do this for people for people who read this sub, but this is humanising you. Another thing - put it in context ... I.e. ""A client has X as a problem... I did A, B, C and D. It looks like the answer is Y because it helps the client due to....blah blah blah..""
&nbsp;




**fix 2** - present in the right way for the audience.
Some people can deal with lots of data. Some people insist on it. Some people are intimiated by it. Some people genuinely see it as you trying to hide behind a snow of nonsense.  For example - if your doing something for a finance group, or a bunch of actuaries - you NEED the 19 page spreadsheet. And you'd better be damn sure every single cell is correct. If you were presenting to a senior sales manager, then you want a few pages of Powerpoint with big diagrams and a few bullets per page maximum. Thats not because the sales guy is less clever - it's just what they need to consume information. 
&nbsp;



You don't need to be a graphic designer - but you do need an acceptable grasp of displaying data. Reading FlowingData. Read blogs. Practice. Learn to make an acceptable spreadsheet. Learn to make an acceptable PowerPoint. Play with MathPlotLib/SAS-Graph/Plotly..... Again - you don't need to be amazing - you don't need to be a master data visualisation expert - ""good enough"" - but that still needs practice.
&nbsp;



**Sneaky fix:** Remember how you intimidate people because they think your a genius? Ask them a question about something they know - ""What do you think the client will do with this"" or ""How will HR use this data to plan the company party?"". Give them a set of options for something even if you make them up  Doesn't matter what it is - just ask one so they can contribute. Practice doing it subtly.
&nbsp;

I think I'm going to run out of words soon - more in the next comment.

How to make the business love you (tips from an ex-corporate slave),y2f682,"Hi all,

Since a lot of people would like to learn the softer side of data science (based on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xqmj9q/i_started_out_as_an_inhouse_data_scientist_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), I am back with another 10 tips.

&#x200B;

In most professional settings, it is not enough to be right.

You have to be **helpful**.

This means that you have to give more than just an answer.

You have to help your client understand where the answer is coming from.

*Note: A client can be a manager, colleague, or an actual paying client.*

## Here are 10 things that I learned:

### 1. The client wants someone that will take away their worries and absorb problems. 
Be that person.

### 2. Help the client understand why a recommendation makes sense. 
Give them reasons.

### 3. When presenting a recommendation, change statements into questions. 
“I would suggest X because of Y. Does this make sense to you?”

### 4. When talking to a client, rephrase his problem to make sure you both understand each-other. 
“So you think your customers are leaving because of bad customer service? Is that correct?”

### 5. Before you can help someone, you have to understand what’s on their mind. 
Ask a lot of questions, shut up and listen.

### 6. Don’t assume someone is a mind reader. 
Say what you think, but try to word it in a constructive way. Just saying that something is dumb is not helpful. Explain why the idea will not work, and come up with a new idea that you together can build upon.

### 7. Take notes during meetings and review them before the next meeting.
This will help in avoiding surprises.

### 8. If you like working with someone, say it. 
It builds the relationship which helps in collaboration. Do this only if you mean it though.

### 9. Almost everyone on every level in a serious profession feels imposter syndrome. 
Trust yourself; you know more than you think you do.

### 10. The key to solving problems is curiosity. 
Focus on what you don’t know, instead of what you know. Keep asking questions.

&#x200B;

I hope you found this useful and good luck with your projects!

Moving to a company where you are the only DS: growth opportunity or suicidal move?,mspnso,"In my current DS job I am free to experiment with models and my boss lets me do some R&D. However, the production side is deficient: they use old tools, and very outdated pipelines and technologies. Most of the time we do ad hoc analyses for clients that require no production at all. I feel the need to grow my skills on production, and that's something I can't do where I am now.

That's why I'm looking for another job, even though I like my current company, boss and colleagues.

I was contacted for a new opportunity by a cool non-profit organization: they want to start a DS project that sounds very interesting to me (and useful for society IMHO), but there's one caveat: I'd be the first DS ever there. I would basically need to build everything from scratch, all by myself.

One one side, I could build a good career, I'd be plenty of room to do things my way. On the other side I'd be all alone, without anyone to learn with and from.

In career terms, would that be a suicidal move? Is there a risk to ""cut myself out"" the DS job market?

Have you every been the first DS in a company? Did you ever move from ""multi DS"" to ""single DS"" companies? And what have your learned from that?

Advice on how to do volunteer Data Science work?,kcbk5u,"I've been wanting to do some volunteer work but I'm struggling to find any opportunities. So far, I've reached out to Data For Good and signed up for INFORMS. As far as I can tell, INFORMS requires you to apply if they get a project and then you'll have to wait and see. It also looks like Data For Good is focused in Canada and I don't live in Canada so I doubt I'll get a response. Does anyone know of any other Data communities where I could volunteer and help out?

I have heard of DataKind but I also know that they're very well known in this space and the screening and hiring process has gotten harder to crack (correct me if this is a misconception)

Cultural debt is more dangerous than technical debt,m16lqf,"You can revert code, but you can’t revert culture.

Technical debt comes in when you choose a limited, easy solution and then have to rework it down the line. It’s the result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) systems, in particular, have a special ability to increase technical debt - because of hidden feedback loops, for example. 

There are consequences to this, but most teams accept the fact that *some* technical debt will always occur. And they’re okay with it because they know they’ll end up fixing whatever comprises they may have made.

Of course, you actually have to fix those issues. If you don’t, your debt will incur interest and you’ll pay for it 10x eventually.

Cultural debt is much more dangerous than technical debt. Once you hire the wrong people, it’s very hard to “fix”.

For example, you can’t just reverse a lack of diversity by hiring more people from underrepresented groups if 95% of your org is already just white males. New candidates won’t want to join and they’ll have no reason to - you’re going to have to start from scratch and think about what inclusion really means to you.

The same goes with setting your values. It’s a really vague word, right? Your “values” is normally just a bullshit term that companies put on their career pages - very few are actually intentional about defining the type of workplace they want to build.

By the time you’ve scaled, though, and you have hundreds of employees across different global offices, you’re going to have a hard time enabling the sort of principles that you want to see. You can’t just implement a culture of “open feedback” if for the past 2 years you’ve been doing no employee surveys or sharing employees’ anonymous feedback with everyone.

Cultural debt is especially dangerous when your managers don’t have an understanding of what type of organization you are trying to build. Managers have a multiplier effect on the organization - it’s a 1 to N dynamic.

And when you don’t invest in your management, that’s when you really see the consequences of weak culture. Your managers are going to be recruiting, managing, and leading. They will be the fundamental reason behind cultural debt spreading (or not spreading if you’ve properly invested in your people).

Most times, cultural debt occurs because people think that it’s at odds with actually getting shit done. They dismiss it as unimportant and what happens is that your people don’t get the time to grow and learn. After all, they’re too busy in their day to day.

If only solving these underlying issues were as simple as a git command. But it’s not because people are [complex](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/how-kevin-scott-motivates-engineers) and messy.

And the best thing you can do to minimize cultural debt is to be very intentional about the organization you want to build right from the start.

"There is no perfect interview process, only trade-offs",ls9c1r,"Something that gets discussed here often are interviews - and specifically which is the ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to interview.

**There is no universally ""right"" way to interview, and I think that is super important for both hiring managers and candidates to understand.**

The reason? You are always making trade-offs:

* Shorter, more concise interview process introduce a higher risk of hiring the wrong candidate. Longer, more in-depth interview processes introduce a higher risk of false negatives (i.e., rejecting a candidate who would actually be great for the job), and a higher risk of just repelling qualified candidates.
* A focus on quizzes/tests/quick reaction questions introduces a high risk of giving good scores to people who either ""studied how to interview"" or just got lucky and knew the answers to those specific questions. Focusing instead only on their work experience introduces a high risk of hiring someone who can't think on their feet.

Having said that, in my experience there are a couple of universal ""truths"" in a statistical sense that really help with interviewing:

**People with a history of being productive are likely going to continue to be productive in the future. People with a history that lacks productivity are unlikely to become productive just for you.**

In my life, I've seen many candidates that looked great on paper. Had the right classes, knew the right things, talked the big game, etc. - but for some reason, when they actually got hired, would struggle to get things done. Everything would take too long, they would overthink things, didn't know when to ask for help, etc.

And that's when the red flag showed up retroactively: they knew all the right things, but had never produced. Whether in grad school (publications, projects, etc.) or work, the ratio of how much they knew and how much they did was off.

In my experience, this is mostly an inherent trait. Some people just find way to get things done, and some people just find ways to not get things done. And as far as I know, there is very little you can do as a manager to change that in a person.

What it has taught me is that someone that aces every part of the interview *but has nothing to show for in his previous places of employment* becomes a huge concern unless they have a great explanation as to why. And 99/100, there is no great reason why.

Message for hiring managers: focus on evidence of production in candidates.

Message for candidates: make your resume scream ""I get stuff done"". Achievements matter *way* more than things you know.

EDIT: Because a lot of people are asking ""how do I write down any achievements if I'm a student/have an NDA/etc.

Two things here:

1. You're going to be compared against a benchmark: someone fresh out of a MS is going to get graded on a completely different scale than someone with 2 years experience. So keep that in mind, and realize that you need to look productive relative to your peers.
2. You don't need to provide a ton of detail to show you were productive. Ideally you can say something like ""delivered $2M in revenue by implementing a blah model in blah"", but if you're not allowed to disclose those details you can just remove the quantities and keep it more vague. What *does* become critical is that you provide a cumulative list of projects/impact that looks good. If you're worked there for 2 years, you need to either have 1-2 *really* impressive accomplishments, or 4-6 more moderate/minor ones, but you need a combination of volume and impact that stands out.

Something that I think people often miss here: don't ""combine"" or ""aggregate"" projects. Don't say things like ""delivered $5M in value across several projects"". Nope, list every single project. Don't say things like ""collaborated on several cross-department initiatives"". Nope, list every single one and what you did in them - even if minor.

For example, compare these two lists:

* Delivered $2M in revenue as part of a multi-year, strategic plan to overhaul sales analytics process.

vs.

* Generated $200K in costs savings by optimizing ad spend across channels using a linear programming approach.
* Identified $300K in additional revenue opportunities through targeted price increases.
* Mitigated COGS increases of 2% by consolidating volume across multiple brands
* Helped leadership identify $50K in redundancies by providing ad-hoc analysis to identify redunancies.

What would you prefer to see? Hiring managers are almost surely going to prefer list #2, because it tells me you've generated value in a lot of different ways, a lot of different times. That means more samples that say ""I do things"".

If you're a fresh grad, what's critical is to make sure you cover every paper, report, document, project, etc., you've done. So avoid things like:

* Conducted cross-functional research in the area of blah

And instead break that down to what it actually meant:

* Performed literature review (over 30 manuscripts) in blah design, blah algorithms and blah optimization.
* Conducted weekly research meetings with researchers in the schools of Basket Weaving and Synchronized Swimming
* Prototyped novel model using combination of Python and smoke signals.
* Delivered monthly status updates to advisor

**Finding someone who knows how to do the things you need them to do right now is less important than finding someone who can learn the things you will need them to do now and in the future quickly**

The only constant in workplaces is change. A lot of hiring managers, when looking to hire someone, ask themselves ""what would this person do today?"", and then focus on finding people who are doing *exactly* those things today.

Now, if that pool is of candidates is big (e.g., you need them to code in Python), then that's a perfectly reasonble approach. But if that pool of candidates is small (e.g., you need people with experience in one specific algorithm), then you're going to get yourself in trouble because the odds of finding someone who is both an excellent applicant and has that exact experience is very, very small. Going to the previous point, you should be putting a lot more emphasis on finding productive people than finding people with the exact experience you want.

Why? Because experience can be acquired. People can learn. Not only that, what you may be having them do today may not be what they're doing in 6 months. Hell, maybe that person comes in and they themselves are able to suggest a new approach that works better than what you were doing before, rendering that skillset obsolete.

**A candidates' current skillset is largely dictates by their current job, and should not be taken as a fixed, static skillset**

I like sports analogies, so here goes one: Joe Thomas was an 11 year starter on the offensive line for the Cleveland Browns. A 10x pro bowler and 6x all pro, the guy is almost surely a first ballot hall of famer.

During his playing career, his weight was 325lbs. Here is a side-by-side of Joe Thomas during his playing days and now - after retirement.

https://preview.redd.it/go8lfyo47nj61.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=16914ad5a9fc3fbda99cc0a885337827e4ac4be4

Joe Thomas is currently 250 lbs. It took him less than 6 months to lose that weight. Why? Well, to play at 325, his diet looked something like this:

>Breakfast was usually a big bowl of oatmeal, a big thing of Greek yogurt with berries, granola, flax seed, honey, and then maybe 8-10 scrambled eggs and 4-5 pieces of bacon. Between breakfast and lunch, I’d have some type of snack, whether that was beef jerky, a protein shake, or a high-calorie smoothie. Lunch was a hamburger with all the fixings, plus french fries.  
>  
>Thomas went on to describe other aspects of his daily diet, including:  
>  
>A post-practice smoothie  
>  
>A tray of lasagna for dinner with a glass of whole milk  
>  
>A frozen pizza  
>  
>A sleeve of Girl Scout cookies and a bowl of ice cream right before bed

That is, to stay at 325, Joe Thomas had to *work.* And by work, I mean eat. A lot. All the time.

Ok, great story - what's the point of it?

When you look at candidates that have been in one environment for several years, hiring managers often look at their resume and assume that what they're doing now is just who they are. ""Oh, this person has been doing a bunch of ad-hoc analysis and BI reporting - not what I'm looking for, I need someone building models"".

And that is the wrong take, because for all we know, that candidates doing ad hoc analysis and BI reports is just Joe Thomas eating an entire frozen pizza before dinner. That is, it's a person that is doing what they need to do in order to do their current job well. Joe Thomas' job was to be huge and stop other huge people from hitting his QB. The guy doing ad hoc reports' job is to do ad hoc reports.

So what do you do with a candidate that has done mostly BI work but wants a position doing modeling? Two things:

1. You measure productivity. Their job was to do ad hoc reporting and building BI reports. How good were they at that? Did they differentiate themselves in that field? How many times did they go above and beyond what other people would have done in that role?
2. What experience do they have with modeling - not in this previous role, but ever? How well can they speak to that experience? And how excited are they to pick it back up?
3. What experience do they have learning something new? In doing ad hoc reporting and BI work, did they have to learn new technologies or languages?

Again, you can take the super risk averse stance and just not even entertain the thought of hiring someone without the exact experience you're looking for - but you are overwhelmingly likely to miss out on some great candidates.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ls9c1r/there_is_no_perfect_interview_process_only/,dfphd,335,,81,Top - all

I learned more from studying for technical interviews than I did taking classes in college.,cqw180,"My story might not be everyone’s or even the story of most people. 

But school gave me an overview of several topics. 

Data structures and algorithms class taught me the sorting algorithms, recursion, evolved recursion(dynamic programming), and the space-time trade off for various data structures...but I only had a few assignments to internalize the several concepts I was taught. 

Preparing for interviews and learning how to code these concepts taught me so much more. For one, I had to implement all of these from scratch and I practiced them much more than once or twice(unlike in school). I was also exposed to many more algorithms thanks to geeksforgeeks and the interview questions I had. 

My initial data science class taught me how to query from api’s, create visualizations, some linear/logistic regression and use Hadoop for a bigram word counts. 

But studying for interviews taught me these same concepts in much more depth and gave me much more muscle memory. 

Same with sql- my school never had a proper class on sql- we had one group project for a client where we dabbled in sql a little

It was only after practicing sqlzoo and hackerrank that I actually even truly understood sql. 

I look back and ask why. It’s simple- I learn better when answering quiz like questions on several topics over and over again and writing code for the same algorithms several times. School doesn’t give you that opportunity to fail your way to understanding the material.

Data Science in HR - People Analytics,12bseqo,"# Preface

Some time ago a redditor posted on this sub asking for advice regarding a people analytics data science role. I’ve been in the field for 5 years now as a data scientist so I commented that I’d be happy to have a chat. A lot of people actually DMd me asking for more info so I figured I’d make a post about it.

# What is People Analytics (PA)

HR departments usually have dedicated groups focusing on Compensation, Benefits, Talent Acquisition, Diversity and Inclusion and so on.

All those departments usually have a lot of data but do very little with it analytically. A lot of the work done is more of a reporting nature, and if any analytics is done it’s usually very basic or uses a third party consulting firm for benchmarking and what not.

The idea of people analytics is simply doing actual analytics on this data. It does no necessarily mean data science and machine learning though. In most cases, the org simply does not have enough headcount to do that. Thanks fully I’ve worked mostly with large orgs and have had the opportunity to do a lot of machine learning work there given that they have sufficient data.

But regardless of whether ML is involved or not, it is about doing valuable analytics to generate insights about your workforce. I’ve listed some example projects further down in this post.

# Pros & Cons

## Pros:

This field allows you to generate actual business value and work with very interesting data. Everything regarding the workforce can be linked back to a monetary value of some sort. For example, Turnover can be linked to the cost of recruitment and hiring, so by providing ways to reduce turnover, you provide ways to reduce cost to the organization. So you can become very valuable to your organization.

Additionally, it is also growing very fast. HR is archaic and really lacks behind in terms of analytics. Companies are realizing this and trying to act on it. I get a lot of recruiters reach out to me on LinkedIn for a DS position on a new PA team.

## Cons:

The data science ceiling is low, mostly because of the data. I have worked with large organizations with 50,000+ employees. So in those cases I can run a variety of models because my sample size is good. But most companies are not that big. You will struggle to build meaningful models when your company only has 1000-5000 employees mainly because most analyses will be focus on a subset of that full population, further reducing your sample size.

So this is not a field where you'll have a ton of opportunity to work a lot with deep learning, or anything more advanced than GLMs or boosted models. Your audience is also highly likely not technical, so the methodology you use has to be easily explainable.

Another big issue is the fact that a lot of people-data-based ML models will have poor performance. This is mostly because you try to model something behavioral, without the necessary data. For example, predicting turnover - whether someone leaves an org or not is very rarely captured by just their pay and job characteristics. There are a lot of behavioral and qualitative factors that are just not available in your data.

So your model is sub optimal, but the business still expects answers. So you have to be able to understand how to work with such models, and how to best manage expectations and derive feasible outcomes.

# ML Project Examples

## Pay Equity

The first very common project is pay equity - are employees being discriminated against on the basis of gender, age or race? This is usually just a multiple regression problem where you attempt to build a model that replicates the organizations pay philosophy and attempt to predict pay for every employee. You can then add in variables like gender and race and determine if there is a discrepancy and if it is statically significant. These types of projects are heavily legally regulated so you have very little to no flexibility in your approach.

These types of projects also shed light on whether the organizations pay philosophy is observed in practice and can pinpoint employees who are underpaid or overpaid relative to expectations. Overall it generates a lot of very good insights for the organization that isn’t just pay equity. and of course, part of the analysis is providing a strategic budget adjustment to remediate any pay inequity across the company.

Pay equity projects are very common now given recent legislature changes in the U.S. and is the cash cow of many consulting firms.

## Turnover Modeling

Using HR data such as job and personal characteristics, compensation, survey data and so on to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization.

This can also shed some light onto what factors can drive turnover and help identify turnover hotspots in the organization. These analyses are rarely accurate at an individual level, but aggregated at a higher level can be pretty powerful.

The biggest impact from these analyses come from using those drivers and creating some scenario modeling to identify cost saving opportunities.

## Job Architecture

A job architecture is the structure that identifies the various levels and distinction between each job. This is typically a combination of “grade” or “level” at your organization and job family.

Usually this is done in a very qualitative and extremely tedious way. But we have recently come up with an NLP driven approach in which we identify a similarity score based on each job title and business characteristics associated with each title. We then apply a clustering methodology to create groups of similar jobs. Further analyses can be applied to these groups.

## Other Root Cause Analyses

I’ve worked on a slew of other projects that were very similar in nature. They would revolve around predicting one thing for employees (I.e., performance, engagement, overtime hours) and using the drivers to generate insights regarding that metric as well as cost saving opportunities.

## Salesman Evaluation

This can be applied to a variety of roles but I’ve seen it used predominantly on sales roles given their direct business impact.

Essentially we attempt to predict in a given quarter/timeframe someone’s sales performance. What differs from the root causes projects I’ve mentioned above is that we usually work with some research team to design a very specific survey.

The questions to those surveys are designed to help us gain a much more comprehensive understanding of what behavioral factor matters the most for sales roles and we’ve applied these insights to the hiring and developmental processes of these sales roles.

# Concluding Thoughts

So I hope this is helpful for anyone interested in doing analytics in HR. Personally I think its a great field to start in, but not necessarily to make a career out of. I'm personally looking to transition away from it now.

It provided me with a lot of opportunities to do meaningful and impactful data science, but ultimately the DS ceiling is limited.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/12bseqo/data_science_in_hr_people_analytics/,scun1995,328,Career,37,Top - all
Data Science Cheatsheets,a8p7tg,,https://github.com/FavioVazquez/ds-cheatsheets,faviovaz,330,,16,Top - all
Data Science is a fad (Cynical Post #2334),14khdp2,"I wanted to contribute yet another post which is more on the cynical side regarding data science as an industry. I know that many people lurking here are trying to draw up pros and cons lists for going into the industry. This is a contribution to the cons column.

My current gripe with DS is that I have lost faith that the industry will ever be able to absorb data-driven decision making as a culture. For a long time, I thought that it's more about improving my communication skills, creating explainers on how the models work, or just waiting for the world to 'catch-up' to data science. These techniques were new and complex, after all - it would take some time for the industry to adjust, as a Gartner article might tell you. But those businesses which did adjust would do better over time, and the market would force others to compete.

This line of thinking completely falls apart once you go into the history of 'quantitative methods' in business decision making. DS is really just the latest in a long line of attempts at doing this stuff including:

* Quantitative Methods
* Operations Research
* Management Science (Rebranded Operations Research)
* Business Intelligence
* Data Mining
* Business Analytics

All these fields are still around, of course. But they tend to occupy a particular niche, and their claims to radically transform the business world are gone. They aren't the 'sexiest job of the 21 century"". People have been trying to do this whole ""Business, but with Models!"" thing for *years*. But it never really caught on. Why?

DS is just hype, and the hype cycle for DS will implode and not recover. Or it will recover to the same level that these other techniques did.

Data Science isn't better than any of those other disciplines. Here is my response to some objections:

* **Maybe they weren't adding real business value?** Crack open the average Operations Research / Management Science textbook and I guarantee you you'll find problems which are more business-focused than anything you'll find on Towards Data Science or a DS textbook. They developed remarkable models to deal with inventory problems, demand estimation, resource planning, scheduling problems, forecasting and insights gathering - and most of their models were even prescriptive and automated using Optimization solvers.
* **But they weren't putting their models in production right?** Yes, but the concept of doing a regression on a huge business data base, or even using a decision tree, is decades old now. It used to be called ""Knowledge Discovery in Databases"" and later ""Data Mining"". The ISLR of data mining, Witten's *Data Mining*, was first published in 2003. That's 20 years ago. They were using Java to do everything we do today, and at a reasonable scale (especially considering that with many of these problems, an extra GB of data doesn't get you much).
* **But they weren't doing predictive modelling.** TBH predictive modelling is one of the least impressive sub-branches of modelling, I have no idea why it's so hyped. Much more interesting and relevant models - optimization modelling, risk analysis, forecasting, clustering - have all fallen out of popularity. Why do you think predictive modelling is the secret bullet? Besides, they did have some predictive modelling - 'data mining' used to include it as a part of the study, together with other 'modern' techniques like anomaly detection, association rules/market basket analysis.
* **But what about \[insert specific application here\]**. Most of the things that people pitch as being 'things we can now do with data science' are decades old. For example, customer segmentation models using 'data science' to help you better understand customers... You can find marketing analytics textbooks from the late 90s that show you exactly how to do that. And they'll include a hell of a lot more domain knowledge than most data science articles today, which seem to think that the domain knowledge just needs an introductory paragraph to grok and then we get to the Python.
* **Maybe it just takes time?** Wayne Winston's *Operations Research* was published in 1987 and included material that could help you basically automate a significant amount of your business decision making with a PC. That was 36 years ago.
* **But what about big data?** The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem still apply. At a certain point, the extra gigabyte of data isn't really helping, and neither is the extra column in the database.
* **Data Science is much more complex and advanced, true data science requires a PhD**. An actual graduate level course in Operations Research requires you to integrate advanced linear algebra, computational algorithms and PhD level statistics to develop automated solutions that scale. People with these skills have been building enormous models for the airline industry for a few decades now, but were barely recognized for it. DS isn't that much more complex, so what justifies the large salaries and hype when com. sci + math + stats at scale has been around for a while now?

The marginal improvement in the performance of a subset of statistical techniques (predictive modelling, forecasting) doesn't justify the sudden exuberance about DS and 'data'.

As best I can tell, here is what is truly new in 'data science':

* ML means we can turn unstructured data like videos and images and text into structured data: e.g. easily estimating the amount of damage by a flood for an insurer using satellite images.
* People in Silicon Valley can have human-out-the-loop decision making, which they need for their apps and recommenders. This use case is truly new and didn't exist in the 90s.

I think that this kind of 'operational data science' makes sense: using truly new types of data from video to images, and having computers which we can trust to label the data and apply further logic to it. That's new.

But the kind of data science where you think that you submitting a report or visualisation to your boss and then he'll take it into consideration when he makes decisions - that's been around for ages. It's never become the kind of revolutionary, widespread force in business that DS keeps promising it will be. In ten years, ""data scientist"" will be like Operations Researcher - a very niche and special thing off in the corner somewhere which most people don't know about outside of a particular industry.

The only people who managed to really turn maths into money were the Actuarial Scientists and the Quants (Financial Engineers).

My take now is basically this:

* If you work in the actual niche where data science has something new to offer - processing unstructured data for use in live apps like Tinder - then yes, continue. That's great. That's the equivalent of doing Operations Research and going into logistics.
* If you are trying to apply those same techniques to general business decision making, then you are going to end up like a ""Management Scientist"" or, for that matter, a ""BI Analyst"" in a few years - they were once the cutting edge just like DS is now. They amounted to very little. There's really no difference. Predictive modelling is not so much more amazing than optimization or association rules, which nobody talks about much anymore.
* If you just want to make a lot of money doing maths - go for Actuarial Science or Financial Engineering/Quants. Those guys figured it out and then created a walled garden of credentials to protect their salaries. Just join them. (Although I hear Act Sci is more about regulations in practise than maths, but still).

tl;dr - DS is just the latest in a long string of equally 'revolutionary' and impressive attempts at introducing scientific decision making into business. It will become as marginalised as all of them in the future, outside of the Silicon Valley niche. Your boss, your company and your industry will never adopt a true data-driven culture - they've had almost 40 years to do it by now and they're still suspicious of regression beyond the 'line of best fit'.

Are my interview questions unreasonable? Or are my candidates just bad?,kxgqbp,"I do technical interviews for data scientists at a mid-sized firm in the finance/insurance sector. I have seen plenty of resumes, all of them look stellar and hits all of the key buzzwords. But during interviews, I often get the sense that there's a lack of genuine understanding of the concepts beyond the surface level talking points. For example, many candidates get tripped up by one of more of these:

1. If I have a categorical feature, we can encoding it with a single column of numbers (label-encoding) or with multiple 1/0 columns (one-hot-encoding)? Why might we *not* want to label-encode? ([Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/categorical-encoding-using-label-encoding-and-one-hot-encoder-911ef77fb5bd))
2. If they've used XGBoost on the job before - Why might the default feature-importance plot in XGBoost - counting the number of times a variable was used to make a split - be misleading? What are some other options you have? ([Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/be-careful-when-interpreting-your-features-importance-in-xgboost-6e16132588e7))
3. If we're talking about classification models - Why do we use logloss as the objective function for binary classification models? What does it penalize? Why is it ""different"" than just maximizing accuracy? ([Reference](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/180116/when-is-log-loss-metric-appropriate-for-evaluating-performance-of-a-classifier))
4. Assume we're presenting our model results to management. How can we show/visualize the improvement of one model over another, beyond just comparing their RMSE or accuracy? ([One possible answer](https://www.listendata.com/2014/08/excel-template-gain-and-lift-charts.html))

Keep in mind that these are just some illustrative examples - the actual questions would depend on the context of the interview and their background. Also, this is for an *experienced* position, not an entry level one. I ask these questions because I think if you've truly built ML models before and understood them, then you should be able to answer these no problem. Candidates who can't answer these have a higher chance of falling for common pitfalls or mistakes, either for model building or for interpreting results.

I have had candidates be able to answer all of them easily and concisely. But most of the time, I get either a wrong answer or some long-winded non-answer. In fact I just interviewed a candidate whose resume was stacked but couldn't answer any (and even other easier ones). So this got me wondering, are questions like these unreasonable? Or is it just normal to have to filter out 8 out of 10 candidates it seems? If anyone here does interviews, do you have a similar experience?

Edit: Getting a lot of mixed responses. I want to address some of the concerns people shared:

1. **Too much domain-specific terminology:** This was my bad. I used what I thought was the ""most common"" terms in my OP, since of course I can't list all possible names for a concept in a reddit post. In practice though, we've never had a problem with terminology since we wouldn't be asking for those - all such questions would come in the context of the discussion at the time.
2. **Not everyone has used XGBoost or whatever before:** None of these questions would be brought up in a vacuum. In practice, we're asking these questions based on past background, projects, or mini-case studies that we give during the interview. So if a candidate has only worked on NNs before, we wouldn't be asking about XGB.
3. **Give them behavioral questions instead:** We do, but i'm specifically in charge of the technical interview.
4. **Give them a computer with live data and ask them to code:** Sure, but I think this could be pretty nerve wracking for the candidate, especially since no one I know codes without stack overflow open somewhere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/kxgqbp/are_my_interview_questions_unreasonable_or_are_my/,Admiral_Wen,332,Discussion,240,Top - all

"Fellow unemployed Data Scientists in the job market, what's been your story?",la5jw3,"2 YOE Data Scientist from the Bay Area here. I've been in the job market for 3 harrowing months, going on multiple final interviews with no success. It's been crippling, and I'd love to hear what your journey and experience has been like. Partly, it'd be good to share our mutual pain but also to understand who we are competing against.

Starting with myself, I found the interview process to not be all that difficult, but the competition to be (supposedly) extreme. It seems like you have to more than perfect on your SQL/pandas questions, and if there is an SOB who can solve the problem faster and with less temp tables than you, you won't get the job just because of that single hair difference. And even if you did the best, maybe someone has a Ph.D while you only have a masters and you don't have a Fang on your resume, only a medium sized start up.

I was told during one of my final interviews in a growing company that i was one of 7 other candidates (how is that a final interview then??). And according to a career specialist I knew from my bootcamp a while back it seems like job market in feb will be more intense than dec of last year, for a variety of reasons.

I'd love to hear what your experience has been like, what you think is keeping you from getting the offer, and any strategies we can share to get ahead of the 7 other candidates in the final interview who basically look like us in very similar way.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the supportive reply. Great suggestions from the thread:

1. Look at unexplored spaces like government jobs, non-Bay area jobs (although these companies are the only ones reaching back to me. My experience has shown that location is an important variable for companies even though on linkedin they celebrate wfh policies on the surface).
2. People with 3.5+ YOE are also struggling to even get final interviews.
3. The Data Science bubble might have finally burst, and companies are realizing that we aren't as valuable as Data/ML Engineers or don't know how to use us properly (story of my life in my last company).

Physics PhD transitioning to data science: any advices?,n04ga6,"Hello,

I will soon get my PhD in Physics. Being a little underwhelmed by academia and physics I am thinking about making the transition to data-related fields (which seem really awesome and is also the only hiring market for scientists where I live).

My main issue is that my CV is hard to sell to the data world. I've got a paper on ML, been doing data analysis for almost all my PhD, and got decent analytics in Python etc. But I can't say my skills are at production level. The market also seems to have evolved rapidly: jobs qualifications are extremely tight, requiring advanced database management, data piping etc.

During my entire education I've been sold the idea that everybody hires physicists because they can learn anything pretty fast. Companies were supposed to hire and train us apparently. From what I understand now, this might not be the case as companies now have plethora of proper computer scientists at their disposal.

I still have \~1 year of funding left after my graduation, which I intend to ""use"" to search for a job and acquire the skills needed to enter the field. I was wondering if anyone had done this transition in the recent years ? What are the main things I should consider learning first ? From what I understand, git version control, SQL/noSQL are a must, is there anything else that comes to your mind ? How about ""soft"" skills ?

My background: I did a Phd and Masters in Data Science/ML, ML summer school, ML researcher at UCLA and Data Scientist at NASA. Currently do Data Science as a consulting gig, with a company.

**Architectures**

- Learn how to use Hadoop/Spark. But for the love of God, don't spend 3 months configuring your own Hadoop cluster. Is fun (I've done it), but is just not worth it. Familiarize yourself with plug and play systems like ElasticMapReduce (Amazon), HDInsight (Microsoft Azure), Cloudera or Hortonworks. They have all the tools you might need afterwards (NIFI, Storm, etc). 

- Learn how to setup and administer at least one SQL database and a non-SQL type. In a good company you will have a data engineer that will do that for you, but is always nice to know what the hell is happening.

- Don't try to understand and be fluent in every single tool available, learn the tools when you need to use them. I can't tell you how much time I've lost learning tools that I never used.

**Languages**

- DS is not art, you do not need beautiful languages like Haskell or be fluent in Design Patterns. DS is ugly hacking most of the time.

- As a followup learn Python or R, both are languages where hacking is rather easy and straightforward and have plenty of ways to interact with popular Big Data paradigms.

**Background**

- Learn math, really, you won't become a Data Scientist just because you know SQL and a bit of Python. Many times, the problem needs a not so obvious tool, and just using a demo algorithm from sklearn won't solve the problem.

- Before using an algorithm, be sure which function it is optimizing. You wouldn't use linear regression for classification, right? Why? Because both have different objective functions, and are optimizing different stuff.

- Really, really, don't just plug and play algorithms. We are not there yet.

- Start with simple models, and if they don't work move to more complex things. Data Science is not research, we are not competing to have the best accuracy, many times, the client doesn't give a shit about accuracy, just that their problem is solved. Honestly, unless you are Google or Facebook, your problems can be probably solved without using DeepLearning.

- On that note, don't jump steps. Don't start trying to do DeepLearning if you don't know other algorithms like SVMs or Logistic Regression. You would be amazed how many clients tell me they want to use Deep Learning and have like 500Kb of data.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6q1y7b/some_advice_for_young_and_aspiring_data_scientists/,leonoel,327,,75,Top - all

Pre screening assessments are getting insane,191zdny,"I am a data scientist in industry. I applied for a job of data scientist.

No data was provided, just 1 image as an example with little  explanation . They expect a full on model/solution to be developed in 2 weeks.

When I self-study, I find myself filled with nervous energy with my brain jumping around causing me a whole lot of panic and not a lot of learning. 

It also pops up when I am trying to quickly process information or when I am put under the spotlight. Once panic gets triggered, I lose focus and make ditzy errors. 

I have had these problems since forever but never really thought much about them, I just thought I was dumb or something. But I feel I am not dumb, these traits are limiting me. Especially now when I am trying to give my 100% throughout the day.

Following things have helped a bit, but I still have a long way to go,

1. Taking a mental break. When I start to panic and tunnel vision, thinking about some random thread for a while and coming back helps a lot. Even if only momentary.
2. Writing. I find describing the error, and the coding I have up to that point, in writing, usually helps center myself a bit.  
3. Mindfulness. Taking a moment to myself when I start to feel like I am losing it.

I wanted to ask whether any of you have or do feel the same, and what you all do about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rztoqy/advice_on_anxiety_issues_as_a_coder_and_a_data/,BraveSeaworthiness21,328,Discussion,156,Top - all

"For most of the problems I try to solve using data science, the biggest challenge surprisingly isn’t really the “science” part but the “data” part",ns5lwu,"when you start a project with a problem and try to work towards a solution (which is what you should do to make sure your work is actually useful) then you arrive at this hurdle where you have the problem and an idea for the solution at hand, and they are your only lead to finding the specific data you need to train you models. Sometimes this data can be really hard to find using these search parameters. No matter how much I search, I don't find what I’m looking for

The data is probably out there and there is probably some search term that would make google put this data right at the top for you to see, but I've often found that the problem and prospective solution I have on hand is generally not it. Datasets online simply aren't indexed by their applications, they are probably most often indexed by their source. And that is something that I, in my experience, can’t really use to engineer a search term that gives good results (if the data even exists online).

Am I the only one that absolutely hates SQL?,qqynka,"Every job interview I've ever participated in has asked (increasingly complex) SQL questions for doing some statistical analysis on a dataset, yet once on the job I hardly ever use it for anything other than basic data extraction and loading.

I feel like the original design intent of SQL was for it to be very human readable and standardized. But as soon as you move away from even the most basic ETL tasks it becomes a nightmare to try and read and follow, let alone debug. The syntax become incredibly tortured, e.g. when having to nest subqueries and so on (which becomes necessary almost immediately). Further, the slightly different dialects of SQL can lead to some tasks being absolutely trivial in one but painful in another.

I understand it's historical usage, and the need to be familiar with it. But with modern compute tools and resources, I don't see the utility in doing your hardcore analysis completely in SQL. Further, I understand that some people have to work with truly huge datasets and are severely constrained in what tools they can use. But I think that the vast majority of data scientists are working with datasets that, for any given particular question, can be handled by something like python.

Am I alone here? I have almost always been able to compose a query that simply extracts the raw data I need and loads it into python where statistical analysis, processing, visualization, etc. are trivial in comparison. I feel like if you're doing anything other than basic selects, joins, and groupbys, you should be using a different tool.

This is partly a rant because I'm currently sitting in a training session where we are being shown how to train ML models in BigQuery and it seems absolutely ridiculous to me. It seems fine for perfectly manicured datasets, but this seems like such a far cry from what SQL was designed to be that I feel like we're strapping rocket engines on a horse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qqynka/am_i_the_only_one_that_absolutely_hates_sql/,ZhuangZhe,322,Discussion,193,Top - all

I Self Published a Book on “Data Science in Production”,ej5yux,"Hi Reddit,

Over the past 6 months I've been working on a technical book focused on helping aspiring data scientists to get hands-on experience with cloud computing environments using the Python ecosystem. The book is targeted at readers already familiar with libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn that are looking to build out a portfolio of applied projects.

To author the book, I used the Leanpub platform to provide drafts of the text as I completed each chapter. To typeset the book, I used the R bookdown package by Yihui Xie to translate my markdown into a PDF format. I also used Google docs to edit drafts and check for typos. One of the reasons that I wanted to self publish the book was to explore the different marketing platforms available for promoting texts and to get hands on with some of the user acquisition tools that are commonly used in the mobile gaming industry. 

Here's links to the book, with sample chapters and code listings:

Data science questions I never knew to ask until I started working (and still dont know the answers to),a5v1ba,"Here are some questions I have that I never knew to ask until I started working as a DS. I don't have the answers to these questions, because I haven't had to deal with them yet, but I can see that they are on the horizon for me:

-How to work with cloud computing/ aws instances:
For example, if I needed to work with lots of data that I can't handle on my local machine, how do I set up a cloud instance to get this going, and is the experience the same as working on a local machine?

-How to get machine learning models built in Python into a production ready product:
For instance, the most common way I see folks doing this is by using the flask library with docker. I've actually never had to do this yet, but it's something on the horizon and there are very few step by step guides out there.

-How to set up a BI environment:
Bored analysts are often relegated to managing the data in some sort of BI platform. What are the best practices here, and what tools are you using? What's the easiest BI platform to use with Python so that I can limit the amount of scripting and transformations done in the BI tool.

-Best practices for documenting data lineage:
For example, when working with a BI platform such as Qlik, Tableu, etc, what are the best practices for documenting data transformations conducted in these tools for any kind of root error tracking in analysis? 

-Best practices for building a proof-of-concept:
For example, if I want to build some sort of deep learning algorithm that can do some crazy shit, what's the best way to build a proof of concept to get buy in from the rest of the team?

I think it would be cool if we could start generating a list of questions, or topics, there aren't given the attention they deserve on common learning platforms such as data camp, dataquest, udemy, Coursera, etc, which all seem to focus primarily on building models and underlying math concepts, but don't really answer some of the challenges you face in a business setting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/a5v1ba/data_science_questions_i_never_knew_to_ask_until/,neuroguy6,327,,103,Top - all
Any Other Hiring Managers/Leaders Out There Petrified About The Future Of DS?,s548as,"I've been interviewing/hiring DS for about 6-7 years, and I'm honestly very concerned about what I've been seeing over the past ~18 months. Wanted to get others pulse on the situation. 

The past 2 weeks have been my push to secure our summer interns. We're planning on bringing in 3 for the team, a mix of BS and MS candidates. So far I've interviewed over 30 candidates, and it honestly has me concerned. For interns we focus mostly on behavioral based interview questions - truthfully I don't think its fair to really drill someone on technical questions when they're still learning and looking for a developmental role. 

That being said, I do as a handful (2-4) of rather simple 'technical' questions. One of which, being:

*Explain the difference between linear and logistic regression.*

I'm not expecting much, maybe a mention of continuous/binary response would suffice... Of the 30+ people I have interviewed over the past weeks, 3 have been able to formulate a remotely passable response (2 MS, 1 BS candidate). 

Now these aren't bad candidates, they're coming from well known state schools, reputable private institutions, and even a couple of Ivy's scattered in there. They are bright, do well at the behavioral questions, good previous work experience, etc.. and the majority of these resumes also mention things like machine/deep learning, tensorflow, specific algorithms, and related projects they've done. 

**The most concerning however is the number of people applying for DS/Sr. DS that struggle with the exact same question.** We use one of the big name tech recruiters to funnel us full-time candidates, many of them have held roles as a DS for some extended period of time. The Linear/Logistic regression question is something I use in a meet and greet 1st round interview (we go much deeper in later rounds). I would say we're batting 50% of candidates being able to field it. 

So I want to know:

1) Is this a trend that others responsible for hiring are noticing, if so, has it got noticeably worse over the past ~12m? 

2) If so, where does the blame lie? Is it with the academic institutions? The general perception of DS? Somewhere else?

3) Do I have unrealistic expectations? 

4) Do you think the influx underqualified individuals is giving/will give data science a bad rep?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/s548as/any_other_hiring_managersleaders_out_there/,ticktocktoe,324,Discussion,337,Top - all

Ghosted after 3 interviews and a long assessment,l76fr9,"Yep, you heard right, I applied as a Data Analyst Intern at a Startup and I was given a long and pretty hard Assessment to test my knowledge, nonetheless, I nailed it (Even the technical chief congratulated me on it), well.. after that I had an interview with the recruiter, 15 min, short and easy, the second one was 45 minutes long, again, I was asked technical questions which I nailed.

And then the COO interview, it was the weirdest of them all, a guy asking about my hobbies and uninteresting stuff about my life for about 45 minutes, I gave my best effort regardless.

The last interview was on 12/14, after that, nothing. not even a ""Sorry you didn't get selected"" or something like that, I even sent 3 emails, split between 3 weeks and didn't have any answer for my recruiter, so yeah I'm pretty sure I've been ghosted.

I know, ""if they treat you like this when you're not even working there, you dodged a bullet"", but It's hard af to find a job position and this was almost like heaven sent.

Does this happen often? I can't find a job anywhere in data science, should I just look for something else? I even got offered a position as a java developer after being rejected as a data science full time.

Is it a good idea to just work something else to gain experience? because regardless of what you know, if you don't have experience recruiters just don't look at you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/l76fr9/ghosted_after_3_interviews_and_a_long_assessment/,killanight,315,Job Search,158,Top - all

I'm worried about a world where companies feel free to layoff even more tech workers so they can contract a handful of analysts to just adjust AI written code.

I've been following along the Writer's Guild strike in Hollywood, seeing how well-organized they are, and how they're addressing the use of AI to take their roles, among other concerns. But I'm not familiar with any well-organized tech unions that might be offering people the same protections.

About IBMs Data Science Certification,eleuz9,"Yesterday, there was a top post on this sub on 30day trial IBM gives for its [data science courses, specializations and certs](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). I looked at it, saw 4.6 and 4.7 star averages and courses with interesting titles and syllabus so I decided to take it and try to power finish it, since I already have some experience.

So I finished first two courses and boy oh boy - what a disaster. It is well expected for this kind of cert to force you use ecosystem of the provider being that google, amazon, IBM or whoever. However, you would expect it to be a WORKING environment. Everything is so outdated in the course notes, software looks nothing like in instructions, some of it even got completely revamped. There are issues with account creation, 503 server response everywhere, loading times in scale of minutes and so on.

At first I thought it was me, my system or location issues, but then you open forums and see hundreds or thousands of complaints that reach back to beginning of 2019 or end of 2018 even. There are band-aid fixes that are sometimes provided, but something that worked 8 months ago doesn't work now since something changed again. All in all a terrible experience.

All of this is just technical problems that made me tell others about this. What I will leave here without much in-depth analysis is the actual quizes and assignments, which I would call at least questionable in the sense how much someone can learn from. Sometimes it feels like it is testing your ability to use IBMs way of doing things, not the actual underlying technology.

Although I saw all this in their second course, I investigated other courses in specialization since i thought this was kind of a non essential topic (using notebooks and other resources). They all follow similar pattern with lot of people feeling disappointed and wanting their money back. From that I decided to bail from it, and felt the need to share this. All of this is easily verifiable by going to said courses, and selecting reviews - then most helpful. Who knows how these courses got such high grade average. Maybe they were good enough at the time they were made. This would be a terrible way for someone to enter data science world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/eleuz9/about_ibms_data_science_certification/,Original_MrHaste,312,Education,64,Top - all

My IT department at work wants to ban Anaconda and replace it with ???,qxugtt,"I use Anaconda as a package manager because it installs easily and comes with a lot of packages that I use frequently, like numpy/pandas/matplotlib. Lately getting more into ML packages.

IT apparently just realized that Anaconda lets users install packages without admin rights. I don't think they really understand how Anaconda works, to be honest-- they said they plan to replace Anaconda with Spyder, which, um, is not a package manager. 

There are probably ~20 users around the company who I've helped set up with Anaconda so we can all use the same code.

I think their plan is to locally host packages we want after they've vetted them as safe. Is this a thing at all? What sort of tools would you recommend to do this?

From my perspective it seems better to just opt for the paid tier of Anaconda, which has a verification service for packages in their repo. (Our company is small enough that we could use the free option). Can Anaconda be configured to only allow packages from the main repo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qxugtt/my_it_department_at_work_wants_to_ban_anaconda/,infiniflux,312,Discussion,153,Top - all
Is it still worth self-learning Data Science and is it okay to abandon it?,lngmug,"I've been self-learning Data Science, but browsing this subreddit, it would appear the field is a bit overhyped and very oversaturated - with millions of juniors graduating in data science trying to break into the industry.

I currently work full-time in an unrelated role, but I'm at the age now where I just want to land myself a programming job where I can earn decent enough money. I'm worried I'll spend the next couple of years self-learning Data Science, only to spend another 2 years or more trying to get a job.

I should note I have various interests. I do enjoy stats, programming, data, and so on. So I find enjoyment in anything that relates to these - although I'm probably a better programmer than a statistician. I'm okay at Maths, but I do have to relearn everything starting from Algebra, and I'm always doubtful as to whether or not I could ever apply a machine learning algorithm to a business problem. I'm also aware, even with the time I've already spent learning Data Science, it would probably take me a lot less time to start earning money in web development.

I'm just wondering if the right thing for me right now would be to switch to something like web development. I enjoyed learning basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Or perhaps find a Python developer position. I don't really know. Ideally I would just learn everything and see what happens but obviously that's not an option.

Whatever I choose, the idea of giving up on something I've dedicated 100s of hours to only to start from scratch in another field is causing me all kinds of mental anguish, especially at the age of 29.

Does anyone else find Python clunky for simple data science?,zcizwb,"So after years of using Stata I have decided, in recent months to switch to Python, for obvious reasons. Although I am an economist, I feel comfortable coding, since I have been using Javascript as a hobbyist for >10 years, and I instantly fell in love with Python's simplicity.

And yet, when attempting to use Python to do my job, i.e. mainly run a bunch of regressions with different model specifications, I find myself missing Stata terribly. It just feels so much easier to make tweaks to models and run them over and over again with Stata, as is so often needed on a day-to-day basis.

Just to be clear, I have tried really hard to switch and I enjoy exploring ML models in Python. Yet when it comes to simple everyday tasks, I still can't resist Stata's seductive call.

Has anyone else had a similar experience with Python or is it just a matter of moving along the learning curve?

Does anyone else get imposter syndrome about their role vs the 1% of data science?,ryzzbr,"Been thinking about this after a couple of chats in this subreddit this week. I’m a senior/lead DS and I would say 70% of my job is pretty much analytics with a spin. Wrangling data that pure SQL analysts can’t get, maybe performing hypothesis testing if it’s sampled. Once a quarter there’s a “big” ML project, but even that is usually used for insight/internal monitoring &amp; reporting. 

I think i got into DS to build ML led software that changes experiences for millions of people. After doing several interviews recently, I’ve kinda realised barely anyone is doing that. Hence, why calling it the 1%. Obviously, selection bias here with who I’m interviewing with, but I tried to select across the spectrum of startup to big tech to Fortune 500 corporate. 

On paper, I’m probably in the 1%: truly “big data”, big tech, cloud infra, read academic papers on NNs to keep up to date, do get to play with ML. However I don’t feel like I’m in whatever people decided was the “sexiest job of the 21st century”. Where the imposter syndrome kicks in is like… have I just interpreted the job wrong. Am I doing the job wrong now and at my previous places? Is everyone else out there building Le Cun style things from scratch and deploying to millions &amp; it’s just me?

I love it, don’t get me wrong, but I feel like most people are doing analytics with flavour. What do you all reckon? Am I interviewing in the wrong places? Am I talking rubbish?

3. There are lots of moving parts to getting a job. Since I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, I can't provide any new tips/tricks that you probably haven't seen reels/videos/articles of.
4. Scoring an interview has a different skillset from cracking the interview. The former is mostly non-technical, the latter being extremely technical.

6. Again, I must request you to not ask me for guidance without being specific - I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, so me repeating the same advice won't work. For e.g. a specific question might be  - ""*Is DSA necessary to learn*?"" Then no, I have neither studied DSA nor have been asked in any of my 30+ interviews I have given.

Where are all the entry level jobs? Which MS program should I go for? Some tips from a hiring manager at an F50,17avmi5,"The bulk of this subreddit is filled with people trying to break into data science, completing certifications and getting MS degrees from diploma mills but with no real guidance. Oftentimes the advice I see here is from people without DS jobs trying to help other people without DS jobs on projects etc. It's more or less blind leading the blind.

Here's an insider perspective from me. I'm a hiring manager at an F50 financial services company you've probably heard of, I've been working for \~4 years and I'll share how entry-level roles actually get hired into.

There's a few different pathways. I've listed them in order of where the bulk of our candidate pool and current hires comes from

1. We pick MS students from very specific programs that we trust. These programs have been around for a while, we have a relationship with the school and have a good idea of the curriculum. Georgia Tech, Columbia, UVa, UC Berkeley, UW Seattle, NCSU are some universities we hire from. We don't come back every year to hire, just the years that we need positions filled. Sometimes you'll look around at teams here and 40% of them went to the same program. They're stellar hires. The programs that we hire from are incredibly competitive to get into, are not diploma mills, and most importantly, their programs have been around longer than the DS hype. How does the hiring process work? We just reach out to the career counselor at the school, they put out an interest list for students who want to work for us, we flip through the resumes and pick the students we like to interview. It's very streamlined both for us as an employer and for the student. Although I didn't come from this path (I was a referred by a friend during the hiring boom and just have a PhD), I'm actively involved in the hiring efforts.
2. We host hackathons every year for students to participate in. The winners of these hackathons typically get brought back to interview for internship positions, and if they perform well we pick them up as full time hires.
3. Generic career fairs at universities. If you go a to a university, you've probably seen career fairs with companies that come to recruit.
4. Referrals from our current employees. Typically they refer a candidate to us, we interview them, and if we like them, we'll punt them over to the recruiter to get the process started for hiring them. Typically the hiring manager has seen the resume before the recruiter has because the resume came straight to their inbox from one of their colleagues
5. Internal mobility of someone who shows promise but just needs an opportunity. We've already worked with them in some capacity, know them to be bright, and are willing to give them a shot even if they don't have the skills.
6. Far and away the worst and hardest way to get a job, our recruiter sends us their resume after screening candidates who applied online through the job portal. Our recruiters know more or less what to look for (I'm thankful ours are not trash)

This is true not just for our company but a lot of large companies broadly. I know Home Depot, Microsoft and few other large retail companies some of my network works at hire candidates this way.

Is it fair to the general population? No. But as employees at a company we have limited resources to put into finding quality candidates and we typically use pathways that we know work, and work well in generating high quality hires.

EDIT: Some actionable advice for those who are feeling disheartened. I'll add just a couple of points here:

1. If you already have your MS in this field or a related one and are looking for a job, reach out to your network. Go to the career fairs at your university and see if you can get some data-adjacent job in finance, marketing, operations or sales where you might be working with data scientists. Then you can try to transition internally into the roles that might be interesting to you.
2. There are also non-profit data organizations like Data Kind and others. They have working data scientists already volunteering time there, you can get involved, get some real world experience with non-profit data sets and leverage that to set yourself apart. It's a fantastic way to get some experience AND build your professional network.
3. Work on an open-source library and making it better. You'll learn some best practices. If you make it through the online hiring screen, this will really set you apart from other candidates
4. If you are pre MS and just figuring out where you want to go, research the program's career outcomes before picking a school. No school can guarantee you a job, but many have strong alumni and industry networks that make finding a job way easier. Do not go just because it looks like it's easy to get into. If it's easy to get into, it means that they're a new program who came in with the hype train

EDIT 2: I think some people are getting the wrong idea about ""prestige"" where the companies I'm aware of only hire from Ivies or public universities that are as strong as Ivies. That's not always the case - some schools have deliberately cultivated relationships with employers to generate a talent pipeline for their students. They're not always a top 10 school, but programs with very strong industry connections.

For example, Penn State is an example of a school with very strong industry ties to companies in NJ, PA and NY for engineering students. These students can go to job fairs or sign up for company interest lists for their degree program at their schools, talk directly to working alumni and recruiters and get their resume in front of a hiring manager that way. It's about the relationship that the university has cultivated to the local industries that hire and their ability to generate candidates that can feed that talent pipeline.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/17avmi5/where_are_all_the_entry_level_jobs_which_ms/,Consistent-Design-57,306,Discussion,149,Top - all

My Guide To Building A Strong Data Science Portfolio,wajjgn,"Having a strong portfolio is like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight.

When you *show* hiring managers what you can do instead of telling them, your lack of experience doesn’t really matter anymore.

The fact that you couldn’t solve their algorithm question in record time isn’t critical. And the fact that you didn’t go to Harvard isn’t a problem.

You have something better. You have proof that you can do the work.

I spent over 40 hours researching what makes a phenomenal portfolio.

First, though, let’s address some misconceptions about portfolios.

## Misconceptions

**Misconception #1: Recruiters don’t have time to look at your portfolio**

One of the biggest arguments against having a portfolio is that no one will look at it because recruiters have to forge through hundreds of applicants.

The portfolio is not for the recruiter. It’s for the hiring manager. And by the time you get to the hiring manager, he 100% has the time to look at your portfolio because it’s no longer 100 resumes (it’s like 10-15).

**Misconception #2: Personal Website == Portfolio**

Whilst it’s true that most portfolios are hosted on your personal website, they can be anywhere. A Github repo, a notion site, a mega article on Medium – as long the work you’ve done is on the internet and you are able to link to it, you have a portfolio.

You don’t need to spend hours on designing the “perfect” personal website. You technically don’t even need one.

**Misconception #3: Portfolio is a “nice to have” and not something that can land me a job.**

There’s plenty of people that have landed great jobs without a strong portfolio. But I think that the benefits of a strong portfolio extend way beyond just landing the “job”.

By working on projects you find interesting and sharing them with the world, you:

* Attract potential employers to you (instead of always just going through a regular interview process)
* Attract potential cofounders for future ventures
* Get more data on the type of work you find interesting

The above benefits extend into the long term and can be career defining.

**Misconception #4: Only technical folks have a portfolio**

In tech, the concept of a portfolio is generally tied to the following roles:

* Software Engineering
* Data Science
* UX / Design

But I think that you can build a strong portfolio for *any* type of role. This includes non-technical roles like product and marketing.

This is because the best portfolio projects share a few themes.

And those themes can impress *any* hiring manager, no matter the field.

## Anatomy of a strong portfolio project

The perfect portfolio project is:

1. Fun
2. Technically (or domain) relevant
3. Explainable

A strong portfolio project only really needs to fulfill two of the above criteria.

Let’s walk through each one.

**Fun**

Most of your competition will just build clones of popular apps like Facebook or Reddit.

They’ll find the most popular Kaggle dataset and download the CSV file. Or they’ll write a case study on Web3 just because it’s in vogue.

We’re going to take a different approach. We’re going to work on a project that you find fun.

When you build something that you find fun, it means that you’re leveraging some domain knowledge you have or a competitive advantage of some sorts. And that makes you stand out.

For example, because I’ve spent the past two years writing this newsletter on tech careers, I find the data surrounding recruiting, the hiring market, and career progression really interesting.

And so it would be a competitive advantage for me to make a portfolio project in this space, as opposed to in a space like crypto which I don’t really care about.

The second aspect to building something fun is what’s in it for the hiring manager.

Let's say you want a job at Twitch. Don't just make a page that lists the top ten streamers.

Instead, make a page where people enter the name of two streamers and after your code has compared the stats of both streamers, a winner gets displayed in the style of a Mortal Kombat KO.

People like to do business with people they like. And if your portfolio project can convey a ton of your personality and energy, you’re going to have a much better chance of making an amazing impression.

**Technically (or domain) Relevant**

Use technologies that they have in their stack.

There are websites that help you find out what technologies companies are using to build their product. For client side code it's not very hard to find out by yourself: look at the source, look at the libraries that get loaded, beautify their code and have a look at what gets imported.

When building your project use as much of those technologies to show them that you are familiar with the technologies they use.

If your role is non-technical, just replace the word technical with domain. You want to build something that makes them think “Oh, X can already do the job because he knows so much about the field!”

**Explainable**

Hiring managers want you to be able to explain the decisions you made when building your project. Why did you use a monolith architecture stack instead of something else? Why did you decide to make the edges of the user’s profile box round instead of square?

Ideally, you start with some form of research question. This is your why. What do you hope to learn?

If you’re a data scientist, discuss your mode choice. It's fine to just use XGBoost for tabular data but at least discuss other choices that could be appropriate.

If you’re a product manager, set the scene: why did you solve this problem in the first place?

If you’re a marketer, identify the metric you’re trying to move: are you trying to increase traffic or improve conversion rate?

## Examples

I’m going to give you some examples and tactical advice for data science portfolio projects.

I recommend:

1. Choosing a project that leverages some prior domain knowledge you have within the field. This will allow you to differentiate your idea and separate you from the other off the shelf clone projects.
2. Come up with a solid research requestion
3. Hunting down data and wrangling it – don’t just download data\_science\_project.csv

Now that you have the data, you want to make sure that you fulfill the explainability criteria really well. Some things you can focus on:

* Discussion on model choice. It's fine to just create a benchmark model just using Random Forests or XGBoost for tabular data but discuss other choices that could be appropriate.
* Discussion on the data validation process. Are you using any custom notebooks or scripts? Tools like Pydantic? How do you check for class imbalances?
* Discussion on model output/metrics. How effectively has your original research question been answered? What are some different approaches you could have taken?

There’s a lot of value in working backwards from the types of roles you want to target and working backwards to build certain types of portfolio projects.

We can split portfolio projects into two buckets: **data cleaning and data storytelling.**

The first type of projects, data cleaning, really focus on data collection.

Examples of good ones:

* [Mining Twitter Data With Python](https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/09/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-2/)
* [Cleaning Airbnb Data](https://brettromero.com/data-science-kaggle-walkthrough-cleaning-data)

Whilst data storytelling projects also incorporate technical complexity, especially when it comes to data gathering, they make sure to include a compelling narrative.

Examples of good ones:

* [Clinton Trump Hip Hop Lyrics](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/clinton-trump-hip-hop-lyrics/)
* [Analyzing 1.1 Billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips](https://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/)

Both of these projects index high on the fun criteria as they tackle topics that are interesting.

## Sharing your portfolio

You have a great portfolio. And now it’s time to share it with the world.

Sharing can mean many things. You can send it to hiring managers, post it on Linkedin, post it on Hacker News – but the keys to doing any of these things successfully is in answering two questions:

*What did I build?*

*Why did I build it?*

Some good examples of answering the first question are the Show HN posts on Hacker News:

https://preview.redd.it/tzzelrkx5de91.png?width=2624&format=png&auto=webp&s=003744f3ef64595afde64832c7e4bfd14ef6d22e

For the second question, you want to tie it back to your interests and motivations. Sure, maybe you worked on that technology because your favorite company uses it and it will make you look good, but dig a bit deeper.

What excites you intellectually about the problem at hand? Why did you choose to explore the topic the way you did?

Your genuine interests here will shine and make you stand out.

\*\*\*

Once you start to put work out there that you *really* care about, getting that dream job is literally only one of MANY amazing outcomes that could happen.

Any questions and I'll be in the comments!

I feel like a fraud,14fgpm7,"Hello,

I'm a so-called data scientist with 4 YoE and an academic background in maths (pretty much nothing in software engineering).

My first job out of college was in a small ""data team"" (I was the only DS, there were 2 others guys, mostly seniors and sort of a mix of Data Engineer/Devops/Software Engineer). Our team mission was to bring value to the company using data.

Job was pretty chill, tbh I haven't been doing much over the 4 years. Mostly failed POC on jupyter and a lot of non-DS-related stuff (like dashboarding type of stuff).

However, there was one initiative I took that resulted in something that was deemed valuable enough to be pushed into production. It was a mix of NLP/timeseries project which actually gave some very interesting results, although if I'm being honest, it is definitely not worth the 4 years of salary they paid me.

As I was asked to industrialize the solution, I had some help from my other 2 senior colleagues who introduced me to linux, git, docker/kubernetes, flask, airflow, and some good coding practices such as linting, testing, hinting, logging, classes and decorators on Python.

The thing is, they never reviewed my work nor made sure I was following all the recommended guidelines, and as I was overwhelmed by all those new concepts, I ended up just not following them, or not correctly at least.

Like sure, I'll use git to track my code. Guess what, I never work with branching and just commited everything on the same master branch.

Classes and decorators ? No that's too complex and abstract, let's just do it plain and simple.

Testing and hinting ? Maybe later.

Couple of times I have tried to motivate myself to learn all of this properly on my own, but although I have learned some stuff this and there, I have never reached that stage where I feel comfortable using all this, and always felt unmotivated afterwards by how vast those subjects are and how little I knew.

&#x200B;

3 months ago, my manager who used to be a technical guy but has been doing managing for quite some time now, and who for some reason always thought I was someone brilliant and creative out of the bunch (he led 3 other teams with a total of \~20 people) was hired by a mid-size company to become their head of data. He offered me a position here as a senior data scientist which I took. He then hired a couple of other data scientists (they introduced themselves as MLE rather than DS) with about 2 YoE.

Those guys are so good they are making me feel like a fraud. They are using git as if they invented the tool. The way they structured their code, using mostly classes and decorators everywhere just baffles me. They seem to have no trouble with devops concept (like CI/CD), API management, networks etc ... while I'm here struggling with the proxy of my VM just to reach the internet.

I've recently discovered the joy of reviewing PR on github and boy it is exhausting to follow what they do. I basically have to google everything as they are using stuff I didn't even knew existed. It probably took me 10 hours to review a bunch of code they wrote in probably one hour.

I am sure by now they see me as a fraud, and they seem to be both the kind of judging type (3 weeks in and they already had some heated arguments on software engineering). I think so far I was protected by my ""senior"" title and the fact that I have known our manager for quite some time now, but I'm expecting that this masquerade will not hold for long.

&#x200B;

I'm lost, IDK what to do. Is there a way for me to catch up everything in a short amount of time ? I understand that a regular data scientist with ""expertise"" in ML is no longer bankable and people now are turning towards ""full-stack"" MLE with a software engineering background, who are able to manage the entire pipeline and  produce professional code that is robust, readable and maintanable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/14fgpm7/i_feel_like_a_fraud/,Simple-Airport8868,305,Meta,82,Top - all
We are opening a Reading Club for ML papers. Who wants to join? 🎓,125xdzd,"Hey!

&#x200B;

My friend, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Oxford and an MSc graduate from Cambridge, and I (a Backend Engineer), started a reading club where we go through 20 research papers that cover 80% of what matters today

Our goal is to read one paper a week, then meet to discuss it and share knowledge, and insights and keep each other accountable, etc.

I shared it with a few friends and was surprised by the high interest to join.

So I decided to invite you guys to join us as well.

We are looking for ML enthusiasts that want to join our reading clubs (there are already 3 groups).

The concept is simple - we have a discord that hosts all of the “readers” and I split all readers (by their background) into small groups of 6, some of them are more active (doing additional exercises, etc it depends on you.), and some are less demanding and mostly focus on reading the papers.

As for prerequisites, I think its recommended to have at least BSC in CS or equivalent knowledge and the ability to read scientific papers in English

&#x200B;

If any of you are interested to join please comment below

And if you have any suggestions feel free to let me know

I suck as a data analyst. Should I leave the field?,idapmz,"I always find myself making mistakes. I’ve been working at my first real job since May of last year, and I just can’t seem to improve this. I always end up making mistakes like forgetting to correct some formulas and producing incorrect values because of it, or not looking at the data in a more appropriate way. Now I feel I feel I’ve lost credibility and people are not going to take me seriously. No matter how much I try to check and double check what I have, I always seem to miss something and make some errors. 

I am more better at building something than checking numbers. For example, I can build dashboards, queries, troubleshoot, even ETL loads, then analyzing data and looking at the numbers from an analytical perspective. Not sure if I explained myself well here. 

Don’t know what to do except conclude that maybe this field isn’t for me.

"All the wrong things with predicting purchase, churn and similar targets in digital marketing",moaujx,"Recently, I have been reading a lot about common prediction tasks in digital marketing like churn prediction and predicting the probability of purchase on a user level.   
From the articles and books I have read so far and my own understanding as well, there are several things that make such tasks more complicated in different ways.   


* It's pretty hard to commit the so-called Type III error when the model you build in the end doesn't answer the real business question. This can be illustrated by the now classical case of churn prediction. Even though it's not too difficult to build a binary classifier, it's not clear at all what the end users can do with those predictions. In general, it's more useful to do uplift modeling, but this creates another level of complexity because you need to conduct an experiment first to even collect the necessary data for uplift modeling.   

* Trying to interpret the results to stakeholders is another challenging part of the process. One of the issues is the falsely obvious belief that correlation implies causation, and the graphs you get from \`plot\_importance\`  and SHAP values do not really answer the questions like which feature defines users' behavior.  In addition, the traditional metrics used in classification are not really useful. It's often stated that there is this well-known trade-off between precision and recall in most real situations especially when the distribution of classes is heavily skewed. What I personally encounter now is that even the business guys do not have a very clear definition of success. They just want to get ""some insights"" and ""have a model"". I usually try to put it this way: we have a value of AUC score that equals X, which is overall a measure of the classifier's ranking ability. On top of that, here is the cumulative gain/lift curve which you can use to understand how useful the model can be as opposed to a random classifier. Honestly speaking, I realize that as a data scientist I have to answer all the questions myself and suggest something meaningful, but sometimes it feels like the end-users of the models have no idea about what they really want to have in the end, which makes everything super complicated.   

* To be more specific about the target misconception, I just recently found this post by Frank Harrell that emphasizes the idea that in most real-world cases what you really need to output is probabilities. This is more informative in general than just binary 0/1 answers that only appear when you make the threshold-related decision. The same applies to using improper scoring rules that are functions of the selected thresholds. It's not often taught in machine learning courses, but using accuracy as an evaluation metric might make sense for the Iris dataset, but much less frequently in real tasks.   

* Currently, I am working on a task where I am expected to predict the probability of a subscription purchase. The problem can be easily boiled down to the standard binary classification problem with all the issues mentioned above. There is some level of uncertainty when it comes to how the model will be used by the marketing team. My simplistic and naive idea is that the pragmatic way around this problem is to get a decently calibrated classifier that outputs probabilities (technically speaking, not yet probabilities but after some calibration, this is hopefully something similar). The scores are sorted and top X% users (based on the ""best"" value according to the cumulative gains plot) are selected for some form of communication. I realize that taking any percentage of users implicitly means that we are selecting a threshold, but the focus is different and we do not even need to report the shamefully low values of precision. Algorithm-wise, this is just plain old gradient boosting in XGBoost/LightGBM/Catboost.   


I have a feeling that a lot of us have encountered similar tasks in this field and I would highly appreciate any advice and discussion. If you have any great resources that discuss such tasks and approaches in detail, please mention them as well.

Data Scientist is the new Business Analyst,aj6ohk,"A relative of mine is in a top tier MBA program and, interestingly enough, shopping around internships in SV and Fortune 500 companies and to my surprise the internships are in ""Data Science"".

What came to a surprise was that when I sat down and looked at alumni profiles at these companies 90% of the ""Data Scientists"" had absolutely no background beyond this and their role at large companies essentially revolved around fairly basic forecasting, regression and building dashboards.

RANT - There's a cheating problem in Data Science Interviews,15flo97,"I work at a large company, and we receive quite a lot of applicants. Most of our applicants have 6-9 years of experience in roles titled as Data Analytics/Data Science/Data Engineering across notable companies and brands like Walmart, Ford, Accenture, Amazon, Ulta, Macy's, Nike, etc.

The nature of our interviews is fairly simple - we have a brief phone call on theory and foundation of data analytics, and then have a couple of technical interviews focusing on programming and basic data analysis. The interview doesn't cover anything out of the ordinary for most analysts (not even data scientists), and focuses on basic data analysis practices (filter down a column given a set of requirements, get a count of uniques, do basic EDA and explain how to manage outliers). 

All interviewees are told they can use Google as we don't expect people to memorize the syntax, but we do expect them to have at least working knowledge of the tools we expect them to use. The interviews are all remote and don't require in-person meeting. The interviews are basically screen share of Google Colab where we run basic analysis.

In our recent hiring spree, out of the 7 potential candidates we interviewed, we caught 4 of them cheating.

Given their profile, I'm a bit amazed that they resorted to cheating. Whether it was by having someone else on the call helping them answer the question, or having someone entirely different answer their questions, and other notable methods that I don't want to share that we caught while they were sharing their screens. I've learned from my colleagues that there are actual *agencies* in India and China who offer interview 'assistance' services.

At this stage, our leadership is planning to require all potential candidates to be local - this eliminates remote option. On the same token, those cheaters passing the recruiter screening are quite frankly just making it worse for people who are actually capable. Questions become more theoretical and quite specific to industry, scope of hiring will be limited to people within specific domains, and improptu coding tests will be given out without heads up to hinder people from cheating and setting up whatever they do to cheat.

With the recency of the experience, I wanted to take the time to share some insights about the data science interview process. In this article, I outline what to expect at each stage along with some tips to prepare.

"UPDATE #2: I built an app to make my job search a little more sane, and I thought others might like it too! No ads, no recruiter spam, etc.",1ad5lxa,"Hey again everyone!

&#x200B;

We've made a lot of progress on [zen](https://zensearch.jobs/) in the past few months, so I'll drop a couple of the most important things / highlights about the app here:

* Zen is still a candidate / seeker-first job board. This means we have no ads, we have no promoted jobs from companies who are paying us, we have no recruiters, etc. The whole point of Zen is to help you find jobs quickly at companies you're interested in without any headaches.
* On that point, we'll send you emails notifying you when companies you care about post new jobs that match your preferences, so you don't need to continuously check their job boards.

&#x200B;

In the past few months, we've made some major changes! Many of them are [discussed in the changelog](https://zensearch.jobs/changelog):

1. [We now have a much more feature-complete way of matching you to relevant jobs](https://zensearch.jobs/jobs)
2. We've collected a ton of new jobs and companies, so we now have \~2,700 companies in our database and almost 100k open jobs!
3. We've overhauled the UX to make it less noisy and easier for you to find jobs you care about.
4. We also added [a feedback page](https://zensearch.jobs/feedback) to let you submit feedback about the app to us!

&#x200B;

I started building Zen when I was on the job hunt and realized it was harder than it should've been to just get notifications when a company I was interested in posted a job that was relevant to me. And we hope that this goal -- to cut out all the noise and make it easier for you to find great matches -- is valuable for everyone here :)

How do you convince the management that they don't need ML when a simple IF-ELSE logic would work?,15vbkkn,"So my org has hired a couple of data scientists recently. We've been inviting them regularly to our project meetings. It has been only a couple of weeks into the meetings and they have already started proposing ideas to the management about how the team should be using ML, DL and even LLMs. 

The management, clearly influenced by these fanc & fad terms, is now looking down upon my team for not having thought about these ideas before, and wants us to redesign a simple IF-ELSE business logic using ML.

It seems futile to workout an RoI calculation for this new initiative and present it to the management when they are hell-bent on having that sweet  AI tag in their list of accomplishments. Doing so would also show my team in bad light for resisting change and not being collaborative enough with the new guys.

But it is interesting how some new-age data scientists prematurely propose solutions, without even understanding the business problem and the tradeoffs. It is not the first time I am seeing this perennial itch to disrupt among newer professionals, even outside of data science. I've seen some very naive explanations given by these new data scientists, such as, ""Oh, its a standard algorithm. It just needs more data. It will get better over time."" Well, it does not get better. And it is my team that needs to do the clean up after all this POC mess. Why can't they spend time understanding what the business requirements are and if you really need to bring the big guns to a stick fight?

I'm not saying there aren't any ML problems that need solving in my org, but this one is not a problem that needs ML. It is just not worth the effort and resources. My current data science team is quite mature in business understanding and dissecting the problem to its bone before coming up with an analytical solution, either ML or otherwise; but now it is under pressure to spit out predictive models whose outputs are as good as flukes in production, only because management wants to ride the AI ML bandwagon.

Edit: They do not directly report to me, the VP level has interviewed them and hired them under their tutelage to make them data-smart. And since they give proposals to the VPs and SVPs directly, it is often they jumping down our throats to experiment and execute.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15vbkkn/how_do_you_convince_the_management_that_they_dont/,OverratedDataScience,295,Discussion,160,Top - all
Job Hunting Tip: Practice Interviewing with ChatGPT,111h9pp,"One very useful benefit I found with ChatGPT for job seekers is asking it to serve as a Hiring Manager that asks you questions for the specific role you're interested in.

To help it guide you, you need to provide it with some context based on the job description. For example, you list out the job description to ChatGPT and say that you want to be asked questions on causality and experimentation.

Here's the response from ChatGPT based on the following prompt I provided it after sharing the job description:

===**PROMPT BY ME===**

>I would like you to be a hiring manager. I'll be soon interviewing with you for a Data Science role, and you are going to ask me questions related to causality and experimentation. What are the questions you would ask to test my knowledge?

**==RESPONSE BY CHATGPT===**

Sure! As a hiring manager for a data science role, I would like to assess your understanding of causality and experimentation. Here are a few questions I might ask:

1. Can you explain the difference between correlation and causation, and give an example of each?
2. How do you design an experiment to test a causal hypothesis?
3. How do you ensure that the results of an experiment are valid and reliable?
4. Can you explain the concept of confounding variables, and how do you control for them in an experiment?
5. Can you explain the difference between a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an observational study?
6. How do you measure the impact of a treatment or intervention in an experiment?
7. Have you worked with any causal inference methods such as propensity score matching or instrumental variables? Can you give an example of when you used them?
8. How do you determine which variables to include in an experiment, and how do you avoid overfitting in the modeling process?
9. Can you discuss any challenges or limitations you have encountered in designing and conducting experiments, and how you overcame them?
10. Can you give an example of a real-world scenario in which you applied causal inference or experimentation methods to solve a business problem?

====

You can ask ChatGPT to provide a summary answer for each. However, I would highly recommend you validate the answers by researching as well as ChatGPT can give confident, wrong answers.

Job Market from a Hiring Manager's point of view,rjat6u,"TL;DR: this is the most candidate friendly market I've seen for people with literally any level of actual experience - but the most brutal I've seen for people with no experience. If you have to, make it a priority to get *any* experience - even if non-DS related.

I've been a hiring manager for several roles over the last 4 years. In every case, I was looking for people with some experience - small teams, so I wasn't really in a position to take on a candidate to raise myself - I needed someone who could function pretty independently.

It has been hell. Everyone who has even 1 year of experience as a data scientist is going to be inundated with offers, and now that remote work has fully opened up, even in average COL cities you're fighting companies offering East/West coast salaries. 

On the other hand, every job ad I've put out has been inundated with applications from people with 0 experience.

What does that mean?

* When choosing an academic path, focus on something that will make you stand out - not on the path of least resistance. Example: I see a lot of people go routes like ""I got a BS in humanities, so I don't want to try to get into a MS in Stats because I'd need to cover too many prereqs, so I'm gonna do a bootcamp"". That is the wrong mentality. That will land you in the really long list of candidates that look like that. By contrast, someone with a legit humanities background and a legit MS in Stats will look *a lot* more interesting. 

* Evaluate programs based on how well they place students into jobs. This is especially true for MS in DS programs who normally put a lot more effort into it. Go on LinkedIn and see where their grads go work and in what roles. For example: a lot of programs will send their grads to entry level DS roles at companies where DS = Data Analyst. Which isn't bad - but it's a different baseline than starting out as a legit DS. As an example: I tried to recruit Texas A&M's stats department for MS and PhD students and most of them had offers lined up from FAANGs or NYC ad tech/fin Tech jobs. 

* As soon as you hit the 1 year mark at your job, start applying for your next job. I don't know how long this era will last, but right now companies are desperate to hire and they know they need to pay up to do so. Take advantage of that. This is not the era to sit around and hope your company will give you a raise higher than inflation. Go apply for jobs. 

* If you're not getting call backs and you have either a) a strong academic background (e.g., grad school from top 30 school with research publications), or b) any legit DS experience in a full time job, immediately assume that your resume needs work. Seek help, and not from academics, but from people in industry or professional resume writers. This sub can be helpful too.

EDIT: Two caveats here:

1. This doesn't apply to those on F1 visas. Getting a job on an F1 visa is going to be 10 times harder than if you already have a green card or you're a citizen. No way around that. 

2. If you suspect your resume may be an issue, listen to this podcast episode and look at the sample resume attached. If you want me to help you out, do that step first so we can speak the same language. https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/10/your-resume-stinks

* if you're having trouble landing the DS job you want, find a DS adjacent job and then move into DS in a year. Having even 1 year of real world exoerience will make hiring managers a lot more likely to hire you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rjat6u/job_market_from_a_hiring_managers_point_of_view/,dfphd,293,,168,Top - all

Data Scientists are just glorified analysts (and why Research Scientist is the new Data Scientist),fpcltw,"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There are obviously those in companies, reputable or not, who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs in big companies have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c). I was told by a buddy in FANG that Facebook is the one that started this trend.

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. First of all, it cheapens the name for everyone who holds this title. Second, those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Third, being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job more expendable, meaningly highly susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. Fourth, this means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business.

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...

**EDIT:** It's quite funny that half of agree with me and half of you disagree vehemently. I actually want to be proven wrong in this case. But I'm nonetheless surprised that people couldn't care less about the HR who are cheapening the name of a scientist to make their job search easier and directing all their criticism toward a fellow Data Scientist just for pointing this situation out.

Also, yes, titles might not matter for you individually, but not having a clear breakdown of the work expectations in an organizational and institutional level is not a sign of progress. You wouldn't make this claim on the murky division is labor on government or hospital jobs for instance, or any positions of authority in public/private space.

Finally, Science as a title infers hypothesis, testing, validation through formulaic rules (mathematic or otherwise), etc. Yea sure at the end of the day, titles are just semantics, but the other extreme end of that is saying that ""well what's the problem of giving a someone who munges chemistry data the title of a ""Chemical Scientist""? Hell let's call anyone who deals with legal data a Lawyer. What this shows it that titles do matter to some degree, because it infers authority over a particular subject and the technical know-how. To throw this concept to the garbage can so that HR can have better leads on candidates feels a bit insulting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fpcltw/data_scientists_are_just_glorified_analysts_and/,None,290,Career,165,Top - all

I have not seen more than 2-3 people leave in last 5-6 years I have been here. I am not planning a move anytime soon since I love the work and overall culture.

Some other clarification - we are not being asked to train ""data analyst"" I would rather prefer that. We are being asked to train people who don't code and use an automated software to pick and dump data.

Old manager (data scientist) left and now a manager from data management is managing our team. He doesn't understand the project process or requirements. He trying to change a lot of things and one thing he is consistently focusing on is our salaries. He has repeatedly made comments that ""this"" (data science and analytics) team is paid more than other teams and he doesn't see why that's the case. In one one-on-one meeting he mentioned that there are many people on a certain level and company would not be able to support promoting everyone at these salaries hence we need to think about how to replace them once these people quit due to no promotions. We haven't had much luck while trying to hire external people (lack of good candidates). He insisted that we need to hire and train juniors from his team on data science process so that they can catch up and deliver when the time comes. His older team (data management) team works on selecting and filtering data, they have no experience or business understanding of the process. I resisted and mentioned that it's hard enough to find someone with basic knowledge and up-skill them to level they can deliver projects. It would be a very long and frustrating process to train people who have no background in statistics. Also, it would easily take 1-2 years before they can independently take charge to execute things and we should hire at a position if the person doesn't at-least has some basic knowledge or some hands on projects. I also proposed bootcamps/professional trainings. But he was insisting on personal training from current employees.

How to deal with this? He is expecting us to train people one on one so they can potentially replace us? He is one of the person who oversees the appraisals however there is a person above him managing the department as well, we don't have direct connects with this person so no idea what he know what he doesn't.

- Do a write up of what you would have done if you had gotten more time
- Create a presentation detailing your modeling process and your findings for business users

"Company have no data so 80% of my role is creating synthetic data and its getting repetitive and plain waste of time, what to do?",147l18l,"So as I said for now our company don't have data at all and they want to test models for ai to be used once we get data in the future. I tried to tell them many times we have to get data from soon-to-be customers because our tests are just approximation with synthetic data and aren't reliable. Unfortunately no one is getting some and for now all I do is creating new datasets (synthetic ofc) by guessing what our customers data will look like and use them for experiments that are a waste of time because once again they do not reflect real life results but the synthetic results. For now even all experiments are just the same experiment on new dataset because they want to see changes in results and comparision. I have a pretty good feeling that once we get the real life data we will understand everything was a waste of time but management wants me to keep pursuing this approach.

After all I'm getting paid and the work enviornment in general is amazing but I just feel I'm wasting time and will probably do so in the near future.

Dank or not? Analyzing and predicting the popularity of memes on Reddit,mnsqrl,"A new study in one of my favorite academic journals.

""Internet memes have become an increasingly pervasive form of  contemporary social communication that attracted a lot of research  interest recently. In this paper, we analyze the data of 129,326 memes  collected from Reddit in the middle of March, 2020, when the most  serious coronavirus restrictions were being introduced around the world.  This article not only provides a looking glass into the thoughts of  Internet users during the COVID-19 pandemic but we also perform a  content-based predictive analysis of what makes a meme go viral. Using  machine learning methods, we also study what incremental predictive  power image related attributes have over textual attributes on meme  popularity. We find that the success of a meme can be predicted based on  its content alone moderately well, our best performing machine learning  model predicts viral memes with AUC=0.68. We also find that both image  related and textual attributes have significant incremental predictive  power over each other.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mnsqrl/dank_or_not_analyzing_and_predicting_the/,antichain,287,Fun/Trivia,29,Top - all

Interview at Amazon for Data Scientist Role -- how to prepare?,gthgfw,"I am currently a Lead Data Scientist at a large defense contractor, primarily applying data science solutions to business-facing homerooms. Think supply chain, business management, etc. 

A few highlights about me...

* Very strong SQL skills, and I have done a large amount of data ETL
* Moderately strong Python skills
* Top 1% on Stack Overflow (I answer a lot of SQL and Python questions, also ask some)
* Nearly 10 internal Trade Secrets awarded to products I have built
* B.S. in Information Technology, I am graduating in August with my M.S. in Computer Science w/ an AI concentration from Hopkins
* About 3.5 years of work experience out of undergrad, two internships at Defense contractors before that
* Also have security related certifications (Security+)
* I mentor both the cybersecurity and AI clubs for my high school (along with a few other alumni)

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. I have never really had an intention of working at FAANG organizations. From what I have read both on Reddit and elsewhere, the ""work 7 days a week"" and high pressure culture doesn't fit what I am really looking for. However, the recruiter mentioned almost 60% more than I make now, so that was enticing.

I feel technically sound -- but I definitely don't know how succinctly I could give an answer to some technical questions. I've looked at:

Are these good resources? Should I be prepared to write an algorithm from scratch? Would it be easier things, like kmeans, or am I expected to code backprop from scratch? I've done these things from scratch before, but I used reference material... I am nervous about not being able to demonstrate my skills because of being too focused on providing these overly technical answers.

Are data analysts under appreciated?,ptlrx4,"Having worked as an analyst, data scientist, product manager, the role I enjoyed the most is being an analyst. 

To clarify, I define an analyst someone who uses data to produce insights (call it Business Intelligence , Data mining, etc.).In my definition (everyone has a different one), a data scientist does Machine Learning on a production level scale while a data analyst does reporting, data mining, maybe  prototypes or smaller scale ML projects. 

Back to my point, I feel like data analysts get pressured + forced to level up and progress to be data scientists. 1) They get pressured by their data scientist peers because think they are higher on the social rank than analysts. 2) Forced meaning you can only earn so much as a data analyst before either becoming a data scientist or going into management. 

With that being said, data analysts are very under appreciated as not many people know as well as them. Show me a data analyst who has been in that role for several years, and I’ll show you someone who knows the business inside and out. Unfortunately, due to the above mentioned reasons, you rarely see experienced data analysts. 

This is a major reason why companies struggle to find value in AI/ML projects (85% of AI projects fail). Everyone wants to go and do ‘cool’ Machine Learning and Advanced AI, but without the dirty work done by the analyst, the project will struggle to bring value.  

Data analysts should get compensated just as much as data scientists because they bring just as much if not more value. 

Lastly, I’m not saying data scientists are over rated or anything, but as a data scientist you have to build models (building great models is a lot of work). You do not have the time to know the ins and outs of the business. Businesses today are very complex and there is almost always a gray area and exceptions. If you don’t see any gray areas, you are probably not looking hard enough.

"How to deal with impostor syndrome as a computer science graduate wanting to work as a data scientist or as a machine learning engineer, later wanting to transition into freelance consulting?",il4rer,"I am a recent computer science graduate (I earned a master's degree). I have an undergrad in information systems. I went through college math classes like calculus, multi-variable calculus, statistics, discrete mathematics and linear algebra.

As soon as I entered the master's program in computer science, I always felt that I was missing some math in comparison to people who have had a computer science undergrad. That thought haunted me. Because of that thought, I was reviewing math during my master's and took hard math courses other computer science students didn't want to enroll in because they heard they were hard. I passed those classes, even though sometimes it was brutally hard to balance that class alongside my difference exams (which I had since I came from information systems undergrad). In short, my past 2 years of computer science master's were brutally hard, but I had the chip on my shoulder from coming from an information systems undergrad and worked extra hard to pass classes (and sometimes more than just pass).

**In the past few weeks, I had this idea that I should review math from the ground-up (start off with all the Khan Academy videos, then move towards textbooks) because I most likely have gaps in my math knowledge.** Even though I know that most computer science master's degree holders have some gaps in their math knowledge (as does anyone), this thought won't leave me. I still have that chip on my shoulder coming from an information systems undergrad and this, I think, is my impostor syndrome.

**I want to be a data scientist or a machine learning engineer - but the positions I'm after are not some research positions where I'd be developing a new algorithm.** The positions I'm after are simpler - applying BERT to new languages, for example. After I get the hang of the job, I thought of doing freelance consulting work. If during my job I encounter some material I need to brush up on (whether it's math or something else) I can review it on the fly. Even if I have to read some paper on my job, usually the formulas there are already derived and if I don't understand them, I can ask someone on my job or I can ask people on this subreddit or something similar. And let's also not forget that while I may not remember how to find derivatives of complicated functions by hand, I did have all that math through my academic education.

**What do you think, data scientists of reddit? Does it make sense for someone in my position to review math from the ground-up, or is it the impostor syndrome speaking?** I am the kind of person that is always erring on the side of discipline and hard work, so this may now be backfiring, but maybe I should execute my plan of reviewing the math or maybe I should just relax.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/il4rer/how_to_deal_with_impostor_syndrome_as_a_computer/,A_Time_Space_Person,291,Career,38,Top - all

"Does anyone else struggle with remembering, internalizing the basics?",hpc6vz,"I've taken schooling for this my entire life to be honest. It's always been mathematical and statistical, and in my second bout of education, focused more on computing to apply this math.

But for data scientists we have to know so much spanning different fields. **From math, statistics, to optimization, to data structures, and algorithms, to your specific programming language gotchas, more advanced statistical + computing algorithms including ML/DL/ etc...**

How can someone possibly remember all of this and retain all the different sources of knowledge in memory? It's not like I have not been taught this and didn't know the specifics before. But it's never efficiently stored in memory. For some very common basics, I have to look up and remember how they work again.

1. So take linear regression for example something I've studied multiple times before. It's the most basic. I can right now tell you the general formula of the equation, and what it's trying to do. But if someone were to ask me right now to explain the internals of gradient descent (DESPITE taking multiple courses that taught/used this concept), I wouldn't be able to tell you. I can tell you the gist, and I have some visualization of my mind of the process, in that it's essentially trying to look for the direction of highest negative change.  For logistic regression, I can tell you its for classification and that it uses MLE to solve, but would have to look up again the implementation. For example, I don't remember how MLE works but know its related to probability.
2. If someone were to then ask me to explain something that involves more computing and computer science. So say something about bytes, binary representation, how it's used. I can give you the general gist that it's used to represent/store data in an efficient manner. But that's it. I can't give you more specifics to that, and would probably have to learn it all again with more details.
3. With data structures/algorithms, despite learning it before, I can give you a general gist of what they involve, but that's it. For example, a dictionary is cool because it allows easy key lookup because it uses hash representation. A list is ordered and is iterable, etc... I understand the general concept of time complexity but probably will struggle if asked to figure out whether something represents exponential time. Just the other day, had to refresh on the differences between hashable and mutable, etc...

My point is, there's just so many different fields we have to have working knowledge on. And don't even get me started with more http, web servers, etc...  It's something I haven't been taught and haven't had the chance to learn yet as I'm still trying to remember, learn, maintain everything else. How do people REMEMBER all of this? I had to look up the basics of hypothesis testing the other day, as I remembered its gist, but not how to implement it.

Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak,1bln0ix,"Use the Display API to replace complex Matplotlib code 

[ Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak. ](https://preview.redd.it/pimy1i38a1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31492e48a5d39171c60d8e96ee8698c670327e7)

# Introduction

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 A good chart can show us what a model is doing in an easy-to-understand way. Here's an example: 

[ Decision boundaries of two different generalization performances. ](https://preview.redd.it/3rrwu8rfa1qc1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=9425bbe57deb98a854a40fdc0979149637078047)

 This graph makes it clear that for the same dataset, the model on the right is better at generalizing. 

 Most machine learning books prefer to use raw Matplotlib code for visualization, which leads to issues: 

1. You have to learn a lot about drawing with Matplotlib.
2. Plotting code fills up your notebook, making it hard to read.
3. Sometimes you need third-party libraries, which isn't ideal in business settings.

 Good news! Scikit-learn now offers Display classes that let us use methods like from\_estimator and from\_predictions to make drawing graphs for different situations much easier. 

 Curious? Let me show you these cool APIs. 

 

# Scikit-learn Display API Introduction

### Use utils.discovery.all_displays to find available APIs

 Scikit-learn (sklearn) always adds Display APIs in new releases, so it's key to know what's available in your version. 

 Sklearn's [utils.discovery.all\_displays](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays) lets you see which classes you can use. 

    from sklearn.utils.discovery import all_displays
    
    displays = all_displays()
    displays

 For example, in my Scikit-learn 1.4.0, these classes are available: 

    [('CalibrationDisplay', sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay),
     ('ConfusionMatrixDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.confusion_matrix.ConfusionMatrixDisplay),
     ('DecisionBoundaryDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.decision_boundary.DecisionBoundaryDisplay),
     ('DetCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.det_curve.DetCurveDisplay),
     ('LearningCurveDisplay', sklearn.model_selection._plot.LearningCurveDisplay),
     ('PartialDependenceDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.partial_dependence.PartialDependenceDisplay),
     ('PrecisionRecallDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.precision_recall_curve.PrecisionRecallDisplay),
     ('PredictionErrorDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.regression.PredictionErrorDisplay),
     ('RocCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.roc_curve.RocCurveDisplay),
     ('ValidationCurveDisplay',
      sklearn.model_selection._plot.ValidationCurveDisplay)]

### Using inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay for decision boundaries

 Since we mentioned it, let's start with decision boundaries. 

 If you use Matplotlib to draw them, it's a hassle: 

* Use np.linspace to set coordinate ranges;
* Use plt.meshgrid to calculate the grid;
* Use plt.contourf to draw the decision boundary fill;
* Then use plt.scatter to plot data points.

 Now, with  [inspection.DecisionBoundaryDispla](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-inspection-decisionboundarydisplay), you can simplify this process: 

    from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
    X = iris.data[['petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']]
    y = iris.target
    
    
    svc_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                            SVC(kernel='linear', C=1))
    svc_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    display = DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(svc_clf, X, 
                                                     grid_resolution=1000,
                                                     xlabel=""Petal length (cm)"",
                                                     ylabel=""Petal width (cm)"")
    plt.scatter(X.iloc[:, 0], X.iloc[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='w')
    plt.title(""Decision Boundary"")
    plt.show()

 See the final effect in the figure: 

[ Use DecisionBoundaryDisplay to draw a triple classification model. ](https://preview.redd.it/501h2r27b1qc1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3614719f48e74c6aabd0d0754c6b08b80f87d02)

 Remember, Display can only draw 2D, so make sure your data has only two features or reduced dimensions. 

### Using calibration.CalibrationDisplay for probability calibration

 To compare classification models, probability calibration curves show how confident models are in their predictions. 

 Note that  [CalibrationDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay) uses the model's  predict\_proba. If you use a support vector machine, set probability to True: 

    from sklearn.calibration import CalibrationDisplay
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000,
                               n_classes=2, n_features=5,
                               random_state=42)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    proba_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                              SVC(kernel=""rbf"", gamma=""auto"", 
                                  C=10, probability=True))
    proba_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(proba_clf, 
                                                X_test, y_test)
    
    hist_clf = HistGradientBoostingClassifier()
    hist_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    ax = plt.gca()
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(hist_clf,
                                      X_test, y_test,
                                      ax=ax)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn by CalibrationDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/ovcp8hcgb1qc1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=93515b81145abbb70424dcc69bf0cf8569ac4e3a)

### Using metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay for confusion matrices

 When assessing classification models and dealing with imbalanced data, we look at precision and recall. 

 These break down into TP, FP, TN, and FN – a confusion matrix. 

 To draw one, use  [metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-confusionmatrixdisplay). It's well-known, so I'll skip the details. 

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
    
    digits = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)
    X, y = digits.data, digits.target
    rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    rf_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(rf_clf, X, y)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn with ConfusionMatrixDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/tfbcdin8f1qc1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1eaaf8e085e1cff8bb9c4bd971dade508010390)

### metrics.RocCurveDisplay and metrics.DetCurveDisplay

 These two are together because they're often used to evaluate side by side. 

 [RocCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay) compares TPR and FPR for the model. 

 For binary classification, you want low FPR and high TPR, so the upper left corner is best. The Roc curve bends towards this corner. 

 Because the Roc curve stays near the upper left, leaving the lower right empty, it's hard to see model differences. 

 So, we also use [DetCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay) to draw a Det curve with FNR and FPR. It uses more space, making it clearer than the Roc curve. 

 The perfect point for a Det curve is the lower left corner. 

    from sklearn.metrics import RocCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.metrics import DetCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10_000, n_features=5,
                               n_classes=2, n_informative=2)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42,
                                                        stratify=y)
    
    
    classifiers = {
        ""SVC"": make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC(kernel=""linear"", C=0.1, random_state=42)),
        ""Random Forest"": RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    }
    
    fig, [ax_roc, ax_det] = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    for name, clf in classifiers.items():
        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_roc, name=name)
        DetCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_det, name=name)

### Using metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay to adjust thresholds

 With imbalanced data, you might want to shift recall and precision. 

* For email fraud, you want high precision.
* For disease screening, you want high recall to catch more cases.

 You can adjust the threshold, but what's the right amount? 

 Here, [metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-precisionrecalldisplay) can help. 

    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
    from sklearn.metrics import PrecisionRecallDisplay
    
    wine = load_wine()
    X, y = wine.data[wine.target<=1], wine.target[wine.target<=1]
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
                                                        stratify=y, random_state=42)
    
    xgb_clf = XGBClassifier()
    xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_estimator(xgb_clf, X_test, y_test)
    plt.show()

[ Charting xgboost model evaluation using PrecisionRecallDisplay.  ](https://preview.redd.it/8giy5tr8i1qc1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b96373c182f515a655d6f4029f44982c87b05d)

 This shows that models following Scikit-learn's design can be drawn, like xgboost here. Handy, right? 

### Using metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay for regression models

 We've talked about classification, now let's talk about regression. 

 Scikit-learn's [metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-predictionerrordisplay) helps assess regression models. 

    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    from sklearn.metrics import PredictionErrorDisplay
    
    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
    X = rng.random(size=(200, 2)) * 10
    y = X[:, 0]**2 + 5 * X[:, 1] + 10 + rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.1, size=(200,))
    
    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='linear', C=10))
    reg.fit(X, y)
    
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[0], kind=""actual_vs_predicted"")
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[1], kind=""residual_vs_predicted"")
    plt.show()

[Two charts were drawn by PredictionErrorDisplay.](https://preview.redd.it/9uxuobuti1qc1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db276b2a7d637cf53887e4cebe87b9a23593b9b)

 As shown, it can draw two kinds of graphs. The left shows predicted vs. actual values – good for linear regression. 

 However, not all data is perfectly linear. For that, use the right graph. 

 It compares real vs. predicted differences, a residuals plot. 

 This plot's banana shape suggests our data might not fit linear regression. 

 Switching from a linear to an rbf kernel can help. 

    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='rbf', C=10))

[ A visual demonstration of the improved model performance.  ](https://preview.redd.it/fsu1yqg0j1qc1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=860447d0c8a1c0c38539f5fac16998ed928c8714)

 See, with rbf, the residual plot looks better. 

### Using model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay for learning curves

 After assessing performance, let's look at optimization with [LearningCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay).

  First up, learning curves – how well the model generalizes with different training and testing data, and if it suffers from variance or bias. 

 As shown below, we compare a DecisionTreeClassifier and a GradientBoostingClassifier to see how they do as training data changes. 

    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import LearningCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, n_features=10,
                               n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0)
    
    tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)
    gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=3, tol=1e-3)
    
    train_sizes = np.linspace(0.4, 1.0, 10)
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(tree_clf, X, y,
                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,
                                        ax=axes[0],
                                        scoring='accuracy')
    axes[0].set_title('DecisionTreeClassifier')
    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(gb_clf, X, y,
                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,
                                        ax=axes[1],
                                        scoring='accuracy')
    axes[1].set_title('GradientBoostingClassifier')
    plt.show()

[ Comparison of the learning curve of two different models. ](https://preview.redd.it/2ljyfl9aj1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d7af8bd8a4295c54f6f5c3ce41caf2fd2ddb0c1)

 The graph shows that although the tree-based GradientBoostingClassifier maintains good accuracy on the training data, its generalization capability on test data does not have a significant advantage over the DecisionTreeClassifier. 

### Using model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay for visualizing parameter tuning

 So, for models that don't generalize well, you might try adjusting the model's regularization parameters to tweak its performance. 

 The traditional approach is to use tools like GridSearchCV or Optuna to tune the model, but these methods only give you the overall best-performing model and the tuning process is not very intuitive. 

 For scenarios where you want to adjust a specific parameter to test its effect on the model, I recommend using [model\_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay) to visualize how the model performs as the parameter changes. 

    from sklearn.model_selection import ValidationCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    
    param_name, param_range = ""C"", np.logspace(-8, 3, 10)
    lr_clf = LogisticRegression()
    
    ValidationCurveDisplay.from_estimator(lr_clf, X, y,
                                          param_name=param_name,
                                          param_range=param_range,
                                          scoring='f1_weighted',
                                          cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
    plt.show()

[ Fine-tuning of model parameters plotted with ValidationCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/5dcgo35jj1qc1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3d587e59d31902951ba0c9869ccd2bc39476d4)

# Some regrets

 After trying out all these Displays, I must admit some regrets: 

 

* The biggest one is that most of these APIs lack detailed tutorials, which is probably why they're not well-known compared to Scikit-learn's thorough documentation.
* These APIs are scattered across various packages, making it hard to reference them from a single place.
* The code is still pretty basic. You often need to pair it with Matplotlib's APIs to get the job done. A typical example is DecisionBoundaryDisplay  
, where after plotting the decision boundary, you still need Matplotlib to plot the data distribution.
* They're hard to extend. Besides a few methods validating parameters, it's tough to simplify my model visualization process with tools or methods; I end up rewriting a lot.

 I hope these APIs get more attention, and as versions upgrade, visualization APIs become even easier to use. 

 

# Conclusion

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 This article introduced various plotting APIs in the current version of scikit-learn. 

 With these APIs, you can simplify some Matplotlib code, ease your learning curve, and streamline your model evaluation process. 

 Due to length, I didn't expand on each API. If interested, you can check the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/visualizations.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) for more details. 

 Now it's your turn. What are your expectations for visualizing machine learning methods? Feel free to leave a comment and discuss.

Does anyone feel like R is actually vastly worse for dependency/environment management than Python?,ywg9ur,"I hear people tout all the time how great package management is in R and how Python packages are a complete disaster/oen of the reasons R can be considered better than Python, but I've never actually run into an issue where a Python package installation had 1) an endless litany of unfilled dependencies that pip itself did not properly resolve or 2) where a package failed to install/use the correct version of a dependency.

With R I frequently run into issues (even with dependencies = T) where:

1. I try a simple installation of a package.
2. That installation fails because multiple dependencies failed
3. Those dependencies failed to install because they are missing their own dependencies or worse, they require an uncommon library that cannot be installed within R (i.e. Requires a sudo apt-get install command). Sometimes these are so numerous that tracking down everything that failed and why is a nightmare.

These certainly *happen* with Python but they don't happen in multiple layers of nonsense quite so often as with R. I feel confident that 95% of my projects would go fine just using pip, but I think I'm going to exclusively let conda manage my R installations, because it can be absolutely maddening trying to rely on R's built-in package management.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ywg9ur/does_anyone_feel_like_r_is_actually_vastly_worse/,DwarvenBTCMine,290,Discussion,176,Top - all

Is there a protocol for working with people who make really bad code?,q8phlx,"Hi all. I work in a very big company everyone knows, and just started on a new project. I was brought in to work on a new phase of this project so we're not starting from scratch. The existing team has brought me up to speed. 

What they've implemented is a train wreck (it works but not very elegant). I'm a solidly intermediate programmer and data guy. I don't stand so tall that I'm gonna judge anyone, but I definitely take care to write clean, commented code that others can read and debug if needed. 

I use functions appropriately. I've been doing Python for some years and started doing legit OOP this year. I got the hang of it. 

I am now inheriting someone's messy Python. Duplicate ""import \[some library\]"" statements, almost no functions, zero objects (which I realize is not always needed), passwords saved in scripts, only a few comments here and there.

Wrapping up a data-intensive PhD but most industry data science seems really boring. Are there interesting jobs?,nobqjn,"Title basically says it all. I'm wrapping up a PhD in [computational biology field] and starting to think about what's next for me. I don't really want to stay in academia at this point: the odds of getting the fabled tenure track jobs are low and I'm pushing 30 so I haven less interest in bouncing around post-doc to post-doc until getting a TT or burning out. 

A lot of my friends who graduated before me went the Data Science route - they're making good money (much better then we made as graduate students or would make as Tenure Track Profs) but the work just seems so *boring.* Instead of wrangling with interesting data types and trying to solve interesting problems, a lot of it seems to be basically financial or behavioral user data, and the goal is to deliver ""actionable business insights"", which always seems to boil down to optimizing profit-to-cost ratio. Far less of the interesting questions about mathematics and inference that pulled me into computational modeling and a lot more focus on business, learning how to pitch ideas to managers, etc. 

I don't give a d*mn about that, and kind of chafe at the idea of using skills I spent 6 years developing at the cutting edge of scientific research to help make already-wealthy investors in a company richer.

Who has left data science and analytics? What are you up to now?,q75ce8,"I moved on from analytics two years ago and became a product manager. 

I was a data analyst for four years. 

1. Almost two years in market research with survey data building statistical models (mainly linear and logistic regression) in SPSS and Excel (with a bit of R here and there)
2. Nine months managing a SQL database where I was meant to be analysing the data but was mainly debugging a very bad production environment
3. 1.5 years as a data analyst in product analytics where I worked with retail sales and loyalty program data. I spent the first year doing data governance stuff with the client but later moved into an ML team and tried to figure out insights for end users without them having to search for them. 

Since becoming a product manager, I can still work with data and do the interesting analysis but then I spend most of my time using the numbers to drive decisions and if there is anything that requires long, time consuming ETL tasks, I can farm them out. 

So far, it's been a great move as I've always been more interested in decision science rather than writing code for the sake of it (I enjoy it in moderation but find more meaning using analysis to get shit done).

How do you handle business leaders asking you to inflate results to their liking?,lrhcex,"Hi everyone. I recently presented results on a pretty high profile project and while they were positive, the business leaders wanted to see more positive results. 

Now they are asking us to look at the data from new angles and group things together and then retest to see if we can find more significant findings. I tried to explain to them how doing things like this could create misleading results by introducing bias, etc. , but I don’t think I’m getting through to them. 

After pushing back a few times, I am being told I’m not being a team player or that I just don’t want to do the work when I’m just trying to stand up for what’s right and make sure we are presenting accurate information. Presenting misleading results could have serious consequences for myself and my team, and lead to the entire project being cancelled. 

This is my first DS project and my first DS job and I just don’t know how to handle the politics of all of this.  I was told that my willingness to stand up for what’s right was a positive thing and that I should continue speaking up. But now it’s being held against me. 

I feel like I’m stuck in an awkward situation: Do I bite my tongue and do the analysis that I know is wrong that could reflect poorly on me in the future? Or do I continue to speak up and risk losing my job?

How do you navigate situations like this? Thanks for your help!

EDIT: First of all, thank you for the awards! These are my first ones! Second, thank you so much for all of the sound advice! I’ll be heavily documenting things moving forward, and I’m going to continue to speak up when I feel like something isn’t right. I’ll also open myself up to other opportunities. I was previously committed to putting at least a handful of years here, but now I’m not so sure.

"If you've been wondering about the disappearance of data from our federal databases, here's an excerpt from Michael Lewis' The Fifth Risk which explains what is going on.",9psua7,"
> After Trump took office, DJ Patil watched with wonder as the data disappeared across the federal government. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior removed from their websites the links to climate change data. The USDA removed the inspection reports of businesses accused of animal abuse by the government. The new acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, said he wanted to end public access to records of consumer complaints against financial institutions. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, statistics that detailed access to drinking water and electricity in Puerto Rico were deleted from the FEMA website. In a piece for FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher pointed out that the first annual crime report released by the FBI under Trump was missing nearly three-quarters of the data tables from the previous year. “Among the data missing from the 2016 report is information on arrests, the circumstances of homicides (such as the relationships between victims and perpetrators), and the only national estimate of annual gang murders,” they wrote. Trump said he wanted to focus on violent crime, and yet was removing the most powerful tool for understanding it.

> 
> And as for the country’s first chief data scientist—well, the Trump administration did not show the slightest interest in him. “I basically knew that these guys weren’t going to listen to us,” said DJ, “so we created these exit memos. The memos showed that this stuff pays for itself a thousand times over.” He hoped the memos might give the incoming administration a sense of just how much was left to be discovered in the information the government had collected. There were questions crying out for answers: for instance, what was causing the boom in traffic fatalities? The Department of Transportation had giant pools of data waiting to be searched. One hundred Americans were dying every day in car crashes. The thirty-year trend of declining traffic deaths has reversed itself dramatically. “We don’t really know what’s going on,” said DJ. “Distracted driving? Heavier cars? Faster driving? More driving? Bike lanes?”
> 

> The knowledge to be discovered in government data might shift the odds in much of American life. You could study the vaccination data, for instance, and create heat maps for disease. “If you could randomly drop someone with measles somewhere in the United States, where would you have the biggest risk of an epidemic?” said DJ. “Where are epidemics waiting to happen? These questions, when you have access to data, you can do things. Everyone is focused on how data is a weapon. Actually, if we don’t have data, we’re screwed.”
> 

> His memos were never read, DJ suspects. At any rate, he’s never heard a peep about them. And he came to see there was nothing arbitrary or capricious about the Trump administration’s attitude toward public data. Under each act of data suppression usually lay a narrow commercial motive: a gun lobbyist, a coal company, a poultry company. “The NOAA webpage used to have a link to weather forecasts,” he said. “It was highly, highly popular. I saw it had been buried. And I asked: Now, why would they bury that?” Then he realized: the man Trump nominated to run NOAA thought that people who wanted a weather forecast should have to pay him for it. There was a rift in American life that was now coursing through American government. It wasn’t between Democrats and Republicans. It was between the people who were in it for the mission, and the people who were in it for the money.

I wrote up a guide showing how to do Data Science with ChatGPT.,10a7kq4,"Just recently, I wrote up a guide on how to use [ChatGPT to build a website with Replit](https://buildspace.so/notes/chatgpt-replit-website?utm_source=r).

Got some pretty good responses, so I decided to write + document more of the applications I'm discovering.

**I'm actually really excited about this one, since I was in a graduate program for statistics.**

[Here's the guide](https://buildspace.so/notes/chatgpt-data-science?utm_source=r) for doing data sci with ChatGPT

The tl;dr is that I show you some of the crazy data sci stuff ChatGPT can do:

\- Read and analyze raw CSV data. I just had to copy and paste.

\- It could tell what kind of data you're feeding it judging by the header columns!

\- It will give you the python/r code on how to run specific analysis.

\- It even knew how to use scikit-learn to run regression models 🤯 (I mean, this makes sense since it's an AI tool lol).

Honestly, this is just crazy to me.

**Before I dropped out of graduate school for statistics, I often consulted non-technical researchers in the social sciences. It was always a pain for them to run datasets by themselves just to get some answers to their questions.**

Although ChatGPT isn't perfect (and does make mistakes), it's crazy where the tool is going.

I think this is really good news for a lot of people who are interested in doing research, but might feel too intimidated by needing to do stats. Obvi...some bad stuff could come from it. We'll see!

General Assembly Data Science Immersive (Boot Camp) Review,u5ebtl,"# Background:

In August 2021, I walked away from a systems administrator job to start a data science transition/journey.  At the time, I gave myself 18 months to make the transition-- starting with a three month DS boot camp (Sept 2021 - Dec 2021), followed by a six month algorithmic trading course (Jan 2022 - Jun 2022), and ending with a 10 month master’s program (May 2022 - Mar 2023).   The algo trading course is a personal hobby.

# Pre-work:

General Assembly requires all student to complete the pre-work one week before the start date.  This is to ensure that students can ""*hit the ground running.*""  In my opinion, the pre-work doesn’t enable students to hit the ground running.  Several dropped out despite completing the pre-work. I encountered strong headwinds in the course.  I found the pre-work to be superficial, at best.

The Pre-work consists of the following:

&#x200B;

[Pre-work modules](https://preview.redd.it/xou0f70n80u81.jpg?width=1197&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddae989e23f33a7a4024c4acd24b4f18b328588b)

# Pre-Assessment:

After completion of the pre-work, there is an assessment.

&#x200B;

[Assessment](https://preview.redd.it/bbk31j2y80u81.jpg?width=837&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97593417d346eb5aac3d3b1e4f097e02c730999b)

The assessment was accurate in predicting my performance (especially the applied math section).  I didn’t have any problems with the programming and tools parts of the boot camp.

My pain points were grasping the linear algebra and statistics concepts.  Although I had both classes during my undergraduate studies, it’s as if I didn’t take them at all, because I took those classes over 20 years ago, and hadn’t done any professional work requiring knowledge of either.

I had to spend extra time to regain the sheer basics, amid a time-compressed environment where assignments, labs, and projects seem to be relentless.

# Cohort:

The cohort started with 14 students and ended with nine.  One of the dropouts ***wasn’t a true dropout***.  He’s a university math professor, who found a data science job, one week into the boot camp.  I always wondered why he enrolled, given his background.  He said he just wanted the hands-on experience.  At $15,000, that's a pricey endeavor just to get some hands-on experience.

The students had the following background:

&#x200B;

* An IT systems administrator (me)
* A PhD graduate in nuclear physics
* Two economists (BA in Economics)
* A linguist (BA in Linguistics, MA in Education)
* A recent mechanical engineering graduate (BSME)
* A recent computer science graduate (BSCS)
* An accounting clerk (BA in Economics)
* A program developer (BA in Philosophy)
* A PhD graduate in mathematics (***dropped out*** to accept a DS job)
* An eCommerce entrepreneur (BA Accounting and Finance, ***dropped out*** of program)
* An electronics engineer (BS in Electronics and Communications Engineering, ***dropped out*** of program)
* A self-employed caretaker of special needs kids (BA Psychology, ***dropped out*** of program)
* A nuclear reactor operator (***dropped out*** of program)

# Instructors:

The lead instructor of my cohort is very smart and could teach complex concepts to new students.  Unfortunately, she left after four weeks into the program, to take a job with a startup.  The other instructors were competent, and covered down well, after her departure.  However, I noticed a slight drop off in pedagogy.

# Format:

The course length was 13 weeks, five days a week, and eight hours a day, with an extra 4 - 8 hours a day outside of class.

Two labs were due every week.

We had a project due every other week, culminating with a capstone project, totaling seven projects.

Blog posts are required.

Tuesdays were half-days-- mornings were for lectures, and afternoons were dedicated to Outcomes.  The Outcomes section was comprised of lectures that were employment-centric.  Lectures included how to write a resume, how to tweak your Linked-In profile, salary negotiations, and other topics that you would expect a career counselor to present.

# Curriculum:

**Week 1 - Getting Started: Python for Data Science:** Lots of practice writing Python functions.  The week was pretty straight-forward.

**Week 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis:** Descriptive and inferential stats, Excel, continuous distributions, etc. The week was straight-forward, but I needed to devote extra time to understanding statistical terms.

**Week 3 - Regression and Modeling:** Linear regression, regression metrics, feature engineering, and model workflow.  The week was a little strenuous.

**Week 4 - Classification Models:** KNN, regularization, pipelines, gridsearch, OOP programming and metrics. The week was very strenuous week for me.

**Week 5 - Webscraping and NLP:** HTML, BeautifulSoup, NLP, Vader/sentiment analysis. This week was a breather for me.

**Week 6 - Advanced Supervised Learning:** Decision trees, random forest, boosting, SVM, bootstrapping.  This was another strenuous week.

**Week 7 - Neural Networks:** Deep learning, CNNs, Keras. This was, yet, another strenuous week.

**Week 8 - Unsupervised Learning:** KMeans, recommender systems, word vectors, RNN, DBSCAN, Transfer Learning, PCA.  **For me, this was the most difficult week of the entire course**.  PCA threw me for a loop, because I forgot the linear algebra concepts of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  I’m sucking wind at this point.  I’m retaining very little.

**Week 9 - DS Topics:** OOP, Benford’s Law, imbalanced data.  This week was less strenuous than the previous week.  Nevertheless, I’m burned out.

**Week 10 - Time Series:** Arima, Sarimax, AWS, and Prophet.  I’m burned out. Augmented Dickey, what?  p-value, what?  Reject what?  What’s the null hypothesis, again?

**Week 11 - SQL & Spark:** SQL cram session, and PySpark.  Okay, I remember SQL.  However, formulating complex queries is a challenge.  I can’t wait for this to end.  The end is nigh!

**Week 12 - Bayesian Statistics:** Intro to Bayes, Bayes Inference, PySpark, and work on capstone project.

**Week 13 - Capstone:** This was **the easiest week** of the entire course, because, from Day 1, I knew what topic I wanted to explore, and had been researching it during the entire course.

# My Thoughts:

The pace is way too fast for persons who lack an academically rigorous background and are new to data science.  If you are considering a three-month boot camp, keep that in mind.   Further, you may want to consider GA’s six month flex option.

Despite the pace, I retained some concepts.  Presently, I am going through an algo trading course where data science tools and techniques are heavily emphasized.  The concepts are clearer now.  Had I not attended General Assembly, I would be struggling.

Further, I anticipate that when I begin my master’s in data science , it will be less strenuous as a result of attending GA’s boot camp.

**At $15,000**, if I had to pay this out of my own pocket, I doubt I would have attended.   With that price tag, one should consider getting a master’s in data science, instead of going the boot camp route.  In some cases, it’s cheaper and you’ll get more mileage.  That's just my opinion.  I could be wrong.

The program should place more emphasis on **storytelling** by offering a week on **Tableau**.  Also, more time should have been spent on SQL.  Tableau and more SQL will better prepare more students for more realistic roles such as Data Analyst or Business Analyst.  In my opinion, those blocks of instruction can replace Spark and AWS blocks.

**Have a plan.**  You should know why you want to attend a DS boot camp and what you hope to get out of it.  When I enrolled, I knew attending GA was a small, albeit intensive, stepping stone.  I had no plan to conduct a job search upon completion, because I knew I had gaps in my background that a three-month boot camp could not resolve.  More time is needed.

Prepare to be unemployed for a long time (six to 12 months), because a boot camp is just an intensive overview.   Many people don’t have the academic rigor in their background to be “data science ready” *(i.e., step into a DS role)* after a 12 week boot camp.

Career path options as a current Data Analyst,n7vzf6,"Hi all,

Apologies in advance if I'm breaking any rules or if this is more suited to the weekly thread. 

I've been working as a Data Analyst for a healthcare company for the past year. A lot of my work surrounds creating queries to track certain metrics then building dashboards to create insights using visualization tools. 

I do like the field, but unsure of where to move next. I do enjoy the coding aspect of my position (Lots of SQL, don't like excel as much), as well as hacking away at a problem and figuring out how to fix certain issues with the code we have. 

However, I hate coming up with insights and solutions. I don't mind creating the dashboards, but I don't like the proactive and analytical work that comes with it. ""Oh that's a good find, maybe we should look into this next"". I enjoy more when there's a problem to fix, then I fix that problem. 

Does data engineering fit more into the interests I've mentioned above? I imagine a role as a Data scientist would be more similar to what I'm currently doing.

I've got a Master's in Analytics, and could start down a path of data science ""proper""-- building and deploying predictive models, building SWE skills, etc. But my  work+life balance rocks. I'm afraid to give up this job and then never find another like it.

What would you do if the upper management wants you to work with 30 excel files that are being used as database?,qgamnj,"Hello!

Chat_GPT,zejzzs,"This weekend millions of people rushed to check the Chat_GPT. This fueled many discussions regarding the job security of the future. People like Paul Krugman started talking about the future of job and massive job loss as the result of the AI which will be disruptive of course. And this time unless previously that the job loss was happening in the low skilled job categories, it will happen to the skilled workers. Any thoughts about what to do and how to persuade a new job specially after knowing that data analysis related jobs will be very vulnerable to AI technologies. 

“It's true that as AI and machine learning technologies continue to advance, they are likely to have an impact on many different fields, including data science. However, it's important to remember that while AI may automate some tasks and make certain job roles obsolete, it is also likely to create new job opportunities in areas such as AI research, development, and implementation.

In terms of what job you should pursue in the future, it's difficult to say for certain. The best thing to do is to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in AI and machine learning, and consider pursuing education and training in these areas. This will give you the skills and knowledge you need to adapt to the changing job market and take advantage of the new opportunities that are likely to arise.

It's also important to remember that there will always be a need for human expertise and creativity in many fields, including data science. So, even as AI continues to advance, there will likely still be plenty of opportunities for skilled data scientists who are able to think critically, solve complex problems, and apply their expertise to new challenges.”

Messed up my career by pivoting to DS. Wondering if it's too late to switch to MLE,qvkuc4,"29M, 6YoE, living in Europe. Did a Bachelors in SWE, had a FAANG internship but bombed the conversion interviews (still can't forgive myself for missing that opportunity! Really wish I did more LC grind).

After that I spent one year as a SWE at a noname company, but quickly became bored. I still enjoyed the engineering aspect of it, so had this ""brilliant"" idea that I should just start specialising in something cool - and as a result got into ML, did a Masters in DS and started looking for positions with ""Data Science"" in the title.

This is where things really went wrong for my career. 5 years and 3 jobs later I have now *finally* realised that most DS roles are not supposed to be engineering positions in the first place, but are just glorified business intelligence / product analytics jobs. I am now a ""Senior DS"" at a well-known mid-sized company 1-2 tiers below FAANG pay-wise. 70% of my job these days is building dashboards. The remaining 30% are random ad-hocs / data pulls for product owners. I haven't written a single line of production code in the last year.

Here is what's really sad - what I was looking for all these years **did** exist on the market, but this role has always been called **MLE**, not **DS**! I have also realised that I should stop working at mid-sized companies, as 99% of these are simply not mature enough to have any meaningful ML applications. The [""trimodal nature""](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/) article has also been quite an eye-opener for me - never realised just how underpaid I was compared to FAANGs in Europe.

Basically it took me 6 years to finally pin down my ideal career path (an MLE at a large established firm), but I now have a bitter realisation that I have deviated from it way too much to be successful any time soon.

I can now see two options for myself:

1. Stay on the ""deviated"" DS path and grow more towards a ""business problem solver"" / analytics manager type of role. My manager actually thinks I am really good at talking to people and keeps delegating more and more of his team lead responsibilities to me. Ironically, talking to people is the part of my job I hate the most. I am now due to start managing a team next year, but frankly not looking forward to it at all - to me this will only mean more office politics and fewer opportunities for technical growth (also tbh it just doesn't look like I'm going to get a raise that would justify it).
2. Try and go back into an engineering role, ideally MLE or maybe DE. Quite a few of my peers from uni are now in mid-senior roles at FAANGs, and I am wondering if it would be wise to play catch up at this stage. While there is definitely a huge gap between me and them skill-wise (5 years of no prod experience must have been detrimental...), I still do have solid CS fundamentals, can write clean code and unit tests, can use tools like git and docker etc. Totally expecting to be heavily lowballed if I manage to get into a big company, but wondering if it would still be worth it, as it would at least bring me back on track.

Overall I feel pretty demoralised tbh, as whatever I choose to do next, I'm still going to have to pay a lot for all the career mistakes I've made so far. This is sad, as I actually used to be top-5 in my class, and overall people tend to think I'm smart, but I've sort of ruined my early career by making all these wrong decisions. I am also trying to incorporate reading more engineering books / grinding LC into my daily routine, but without much success so far as I feel pretty burnt out tbh.

Looking for advice on what I should do in my situation. Do people have any success stories about going from DS to a MLE role?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qvkuc4/messed_up_my_career_by_pivoting_to_ds_wondering/,ds9329,269,Career,141,Top - all

How do you remember everything (theory/code) as a data scientist?,146ofs6,"I’m currently working as a Data Analyst/Scientist. It’s my first proper job since I completed my undergrad, and then PhD in Physics. 

I have a solid grasp of advanced mathematics, but I’ve never had any “formal” statistics training. I’m also a competent programmer, but I’m certainly not at the computer science or software developer level. I can write R or Python code which gets the job done but it isn’t always pretty, and will often google for solutions. Because of this, I’m sort of having to pick up things as I go along, which is okay but seems a bit overwhelming at times. 

I’m completely comfortable with exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics etc. However, in my role, I often spend a few weeks at a time working on different projects. Sometimes I’ll work with inferential stats (e.g. using chi squared), and permutation testing. Then I’ll be doing predictive modelling and use something like logistic regression. 

Each time, I understand how these techniques work in terms of the mathematics, but by the time I come to look at them again, I’ve forgotten at least some of it. This especially applies to whenever I’ve tried to teach myself something like Bayesian stats/probability, or any time I read about things like neural networks, PCA, K-means, NLP techniques, as I don’t really use these in my role.

I wouldn’t say I’m a particularly forgetful person, it’s simply that I can’t remember all of these different statistical approaches and techniques in any great detail. Do I need know all of these well to be a good data scientist, or is it typical to end up “specialising” in one or two areas (E.g. predictive modelling, forecasting), depending on where you work?

On a side note - do I need to have a solid personal profile (E.g. GitHub projects) to do well in my career, or once I’ve got experience is that less relevant? I say that because outside of work, I prefer relaxing and doing other things that I enjoy - I really value work-life balance, and don’t necessarily care about making a ridiculous amount of money as long as I’m decently well paid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/146ofs6/how_do_you_remember_everything_theorycode_as_a/,JLane1996,268,Career,71,Top - all
Why knowing the math and/or algorithms matters,v183x2,"First and foremost, I don't want this to come across gatekeepey. In my opinion the fact that Keras, sklearn, tidymodels, ... abstract away most math is a blessing. Not everyone needs to know the details of their methods and algorithms, especially if it's just a hobby or even a one off model a SWE or scientist wants to use.

What I do feel strongly about is that once you go beyond that level and want to make a career out of this field going beyond these abstractions helps you understand what's going on. They enable you to explain the results of your blackbox model, even if it's just to yourself. They also help you debug your models and reason about the plausibility of your output.

Let me give two super recent examples I encountered:

When I was playing around with some old bayesian neural network code in Matlab (which I never use). I decided to change the activation function from tanh to relu. As soon as I did the performance absolutely tanked beyond belief. This immediately should prompt you to check the initialisation strategy Matlab uses. Lo and behold: it initialises a ton of neurons as negative values. Case closed here.

When plotting Xgboost's results I saw many negative values in the output even though the dataset only had > 0.  This threw me off because trees should not extrapolate but rather predict what they've seen. This is actually a semi-common occurence and is just due to how xgb works, the first tree is fit on (x, y) and the subsequent on (x, y - gradient). Depending on your use case this can be problematic, good luck explaining why you have e.g. negative predictions for sales. Swapping out xgb for RF, which obviously uses a different procedure, solved this problem.

These are two simple cases, there's tons more I've experienced in the last few months. I'm sure that you can figure these out with google-fu as well, but having confidence in your model's results is super important if you want to take your career to the next level in my opinion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/v183x2/why_knowing_the_math_andor_algorithms_matters/,None,271,Discussion,98,Top - all

How to introduce good engineering practices to a corporate data science team?,htynsr,"I work in a small data science team (5-ish people) at a large, non-tech company. We work with very large data sources and have solid infrastructure, but the technical skills of the team are very low. The team is all data scientists (myself included) with decent theoretical knowledge, but minimal experience with good coding/development practices.

I've worked as a (junior) software engineer in the past, and although I consider my knowledge to be pretty modest, it far exceeds that of the rest of the team. I'd like to introduce better practies to my current team, such as code reviews and writing tests, but I've never worked anywhere that had a great approach to development so I'm not sure how to go about it.

We mainly work on projects individually, that are usually unique and have little in common, so there's not much standardisation that can be done. We use git, but basically just commit straight to master, and most of our work is analsyis rather than anything that's productionised. It's rare for multiple people to work on the same codebase and even rarer to do so at the same time. We don't really use development methodologies like scrum/kanban, as we mostly work independently so people just manage their own work.

Any thoughts on where the best place to start would be? I'm not sure where to begin given the nature of our work and the low technical proficiency of the team.

AMA / just want to celebrate because most people in my life are already techies and/or don’t care...


------------------------------------------------

Edit to answer the major questions being asked:

First of all thank you so much for the love! Really appreciate it.

My background - Stats undergrad from a rigorous school, no MS or PHD. Got a job as a business analyst, realized I could do more with my skills. 

After that, I hate to be a cliche but what got me the furthest was projects. Find reasons to get excited about the technology, build projects. Go to hackathons, build projects. Add stuff to your blog, github, etc. There are no MOOCs or blogposts that will get you the experience of actually trying to process and model real data with real data problems.

Once you do enough of these, you can start to talk data science with other professionals at a level of comfort that signals that you're not bullshitting just to get a job. 

One other piece of advice I have is to push yourself at your current role in the right direction. I realized that while my current job wasn't a data science role, there were non technical things I could do to help become a better data scientist eventually - things like getting really good at SQL queries, building visualizations and focusing on story telling around the data (even just in powerpoint format). 

Combining this with the more technical data science related stuff in my own time helped a lot - the business side of data science is underrated but often what employers are really looking for.

The last thing I wanted to share is that it was not easy, and interviewing is really hard. I was doing several personal projects, built a blog, participated in hackathons, participated in kaggle challenges, going to meetups, linkedin, etc. and I still bombed at the beginning. Doing these things got my foot in the door - I had the opportunity to interview for top companies such as Facebook but I tanked at the beginning. It was embarrassing and humbling - but do not give up! Take interviews whenever you get a chance just to practice those skills and eventually it will become more natural.

That's all for now, can add more based on interest!

"Those of you who are taking Data Science courses at a university, what's the most memorable moment you've witnessed in a data science class?",rvya1w,"Lots of questions in this subreddit have to do with career advice or discussing the job market, but I want to do something more fun. I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science but have taken a plethora of data science courses offered at the undergrad level at my university (some classes intertwine with master's level courses) and I wanted to share and see if other students have similar, memorable, or fun experiences in their classes.

&#x200B;

For me, last semester, I took a data mining course and in one of our assignments, we were tasked with  using K-means clustering on a dataset of our choice. One group decided to do clustering of k = 6 based off of two explanatory variables: one that I can't really recall (let's just say it was income) and the other one was UserID. Not only did I visibly cringe, but I had to stop myself from facepalming. I couldn't believe a group decided to use UserID and another variable and try to draw meaningful analysis from it. There was a part of me that wanted to raise my hand and ask questions about their cluster but the professor got to them first and went in about how you're not supposed to use UserID in any type of analysis. They had other issues with their presentation and she went into those as well, making it clear that the group wasn't prepared for what hit them and I kind of felt bad. She gave the group an opportunity to make up the assignment and come up with a legitimate cluster with legitimate analysis, so that's a saving grace.

Learn how to add value with AI to dinosuar companies,1cnb8o7,"Just had a big meeting for the data team at my company (big pharma). They kept saying ""AI first company"" and ""save money through AI"" and ""improve productivity with AI"" etc. However, when I stood up to ask what they were planning on to implement this they had very little top-down ideas, probably due to a lack of understanding of the tech or no direct incentives to do so. Instead it seemed like the employees would generate ideas and figure out how to engineer it. 

  
Where I'm going with this is that if you're trying to break into the field or stand out this is a great opportunity. the leadership typically doesn't know what use cases exist for AI or how to measure it. If you can sell yourself like this on a resume/interview it seems like a good way to stand out. So taking a AI application and use case from begining to end seems like a new potential backdoor to get some attention. Also showing that you're the guy that can provide a method to show that the use case is effective (since they don't yet know how to measure impact). Being able to do this demonstrates business knowledge, tech skills, engineering, etc. and is a buzzword people love. Im still not sure if recruiters are instructed to look for these things, but in a networking setting its definitely $$$$. ""I built this AI stack to save the commetical analyst xx% in producing their weekly reports by ......... ultimately saving the company $\_\_\_\_. There's so many holes in companies where an AI application could be a huge benefit, espcially these huge ones that feel pressure to keep up cause this scares them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cnb8o7/learn_how_to_add_value_with_ai_to_dinosuar/,LeaguePrototype,22,Career Discussion,13,Hot

Just wondering are there any ideas for what else I could expect? Is this list a good idea to prep?

Not sure if ""it WONT be Leetcode"" means, it will be DS&A just not problems from Leetcode, or it means nothing like DS&A at all.

Recommendation for Coursera or Udemy courses?,1cmrvht,"Data Science undergrad here, just finished off my first year, and I'm looking to just improve technical skills.

Bootstrap Procedure for Max,1cmjlvx,"Hello my fellow DS/stats peeps,

I am working on a new problem where I am dealing with 15 years worth of hourly data of average website clicks. On a given day, I am interested in estimating the peak volume of clicks on a website with a 95% confidence interval. The way I am going about this is by bootstrapping my data 10,000 times for each day but I am not sure if I am doing this right or it might not even be possible.

Procedure looks as follows:

* Group all Jan 1, Jan 2,… Dec 31 into daily buckets. So I have 15 years worth of hourly data for each of these days, or 360 data points (15\*24).
* For a single day bucket (take Jan 1), I sample 24 values (to mimic the 24 hour day) from the 1/1 bucket to create a resampled day, store the max during each resampling. I do this process 10,000 times for each day.
   * At this point, I have 10,000 bootstrapped maxes for all days of the year.

This is where I get a little lost. If I take the .975 and .025 of the 10,000 bootstrapped maxes for each day, in theory these should be my 95% bands of where the max should live. When I bootstrap my max point estimate by taking the max of the 10,000 samples, it’s the same as my upper confidence band.

Am I missing something theoretical or maybe my procedure is off? I’ve never bootstrapped a max or maybe it is not something that is even recommended/possible to do.

So have received a take home exercise for a job interview that I am currently in the final stages of, and would really like to nail.

However they have mentioned that I would be judged on my sql code. Granted I could probably do this faster in excel i.e. vlookups to simulate the joins I need to make to create the 'end table' etc however it seems like I will need to use the sql and will be getting partially judged on the cleanliness and integrity of my code. This too is not a problem and in my mind I already know what I would like to do. However all my experience is working in IDE's that my work has paid for. To complete this exercise I would need to load these csv files into a open source SQL IDE of some sort (or at least so I think). However I have no idea whats out there and what I should use. also I would ideally like to present this notebook style and sop suggestions where I could run commentary and code side by side a la colab that may be fit for purpose would be greatly appreciated.

The key breakthrough, according to Puig, is the startup’s ability to use AI to identify causal relationships, not just correlations, across massive enterprise datasets over time. “We basically immunized our GenAI from ever hallucinating,” Puig told VentureBeat. “It is deterministic output.

How good is Capital One for a first job out of grad school?,1clled9,"Let me start out by setting some context first. I will be graduating with a Master’s degree this year from a name brand school. I have an offer to join Capital One as a Data Scientist. I went into grad school pretty much straight out of undergrad, and I don’t have any full-time experience of note going into this. 

I have some questions/thoughts, which I’d love to get some opinions on. 

1. I have been told that the role would involve modeling work and revolve around ML. Now, it’s a bank, so I’m fairly sure it’s not going to be some cutting-edge deep learning work. Most likely regressions and random forests and such, even if that? How much will this affect future opportunities going forward? Or am I just overthinking?

2. Considering it’s a bank and not exactly a tech company, am I fucked in terms of jumping to a proper tech shop a little later down the line? How favorably is C1 seen as a name on the resume in data science in particular but also within tech in general? Any insights/perspectives would be appreciated, I have absolutely no clue.

I don’t really have any other offers. A lot of fellow students I know are compromising and taking up SWE roles because they’re unable to land DS/ML roles. Others are still looking for just any offers at all. We all know the state of the job market. 

So, given all of the above, my hope is that a DS title at a fairly well-known financial services company will give me enough of a jump pad to move on to other places later. Even if this is not true, I don’t have much of an option, but I’d like some second opinions anyway. I’m too close to this to see any of it objectively.

Am I really a Data Analyst?,1clqh1h,"Hello everyone. It is my first post here, but I read this subreddit nearly each day as a way to understand more about this world. So, first of all, nice to contact you, dudes.

My question refers to the exact nature of the rol I am currently playing in a company. So, let me explain (TL;DR at the end of the post, here just the long explanation):

* **My background**: I'm a Psychology Bachelor, with two Ms. in Criminology and a third one in Methodology and Statistics. Contrary to the majority in my country (studying criminology in Spain is interesting, but it's horrible to find a job with that), I was able to enrole with a Computer Science research team from a very famous university in Spain, where I started analyzing online profiles to participate in research (both from a NLP and a bit of SNA perspective). As I was very very interested on Data Analysis and statistics (I'm not a very good statician, but at least I am really interested on it and happy to learn and study new things), they convinced me to do a PhD in Computer Science (which was focused on that topic, classic NLP and SNA to study social data online). With a lot of effort, I finished it and continued working on Academia till a year ago, when I was so burned out of several things of Spanish academia that I decided to start looking for new jobs. My environment always told me that my profile was quite interesting, but I had lot of problems trying to get interviews, as my profile is, as we say in Spain, ""an apprendice of everything, but master of none"" (I think that, in English, is "" Jack of *all trades*, *master of none* "". But, after a few months, I found a company focused on social data analysis projects that interviewed me and gave me an offer.
* **The original interview + offer**: they interviewed me for a Data Analyst position (nor junior, nor senior). The interview was a first one with HR, asking about my general CV, and then with a team manager and a ""senior"" data analyst. The interview was waaaaaaay too easy. They shared their screen and showed me a dataset on Excel, and asked me very simple things about it (e.g. what can you tell me about this pattern, what would you do to extract information from this couple of variables, how would you deal with missing data, etc). For me, it was a relief, as I've been working a lot at academia and wanted to have something easier to do, at least for some time. I guess they were interested on me, as they decided to gave me an offer (data analyst, 32K€, better salary than in academia, and FULL remote work, which was ideal for me since I prefered to go back from Madrid to a little city in the coast of Spain, with family and friends). I accepted without any doubts, and left academia.
* **The problem: I've been working three months for that company. In the beginning, I thought I would work as ""simple"" dat**a analyst on Excel (in, let's say, more or less ""structured"" projects). However, they told me that, due to my profile, they preferred me to be involved in ""innovation"" projects, which sounded interesting. On those projects, I'm working with a single manager, which is in contact with the client and tells me what type of analysis he wants on the pipeline, which I build in Python, translating every idea he tells me into ""regular"" analysis. For the built of that pipeline, I need knowledge on Python (they did not ask me to test my skills on Python during the interview), SQL (same), NLP (same), SNA (same), a little bit of PowerBI (same) and a little bit of Excel (this was the only thing covered). Also, each time I tell the manager that an analysis is too complicated and there is another way to deal with the idea he has, he always discards my idea and tells me to do it they way he wants. Most of the times, this means a lot of hours wasted, and no apologies. Also, another manager told me that he wanted me to ""guide"" the rest of the data analysts of the company, which are more junior than me, and structure a whole ""data analysis"" department. I thought that meant that I would work as a... lead data analyst? But they told me that was just dealing with internal projects with all the data analysts to improve general analysis for future projects. I said that was OK for me (I know is naive, but is my first data analyst job outside academia and, to be honest, I'm interested on leading a team). However, usually data analysts are required to be involved on company projects 110% of the time (most of the time doing extra hours), and this means that, each time I distribute work among us and we meet in 4-5 days, no one was able to advance on it due to other duties of the company (each manager wants their work to be absolute priority). Also, interestingly, the other data analysts do usually work with Excel and PowerBI, using Python just in rare occassions.

TL;DR: Bachelor in Psychology, 2 Ms. in Criminology, 1 Ms. in Statistics, PhD in Computer Science, low-medium knowledge in Python (most of the time using chatGPT and adapting the code), low knowledge SQL, regular skills with Excel and PowerBI, good knowledge of statistics. In the company, they want me to be ""lead"" without saying I am the ""lead"" data analyst (kind of...informal?), with no clear duties regarding that ""lead"" beyond organizing small projects with the other data analysts to improve the general performance of company projects, and usually dealing with programming, NLP and SNA to adapt the ideas of a manager to ""actual"" analysis into a pipeline.

**So, the question is... am I really a Data Analyst?**

How many companies out there are truly experimentation focused like Netflix?,1ckulwz,"https://netflixtechblog.com/tagged/experimentation

If you check out this link you will see many articles about how much of a focus Netflix puts into experimentation. They actually explore the literature for better methods for doing large scale experimentation, and it’s a huge component of their DS workflow

However, I’m curious as to if every company is like this, because it seems like everyone else is just “okay” with taking arbitrary sample sizes, arbitrary metrics, and don’t think as critically as Netflix does about experimentation. I mean if you read their work on this blog they go as far as coming up with faster bootstrapping algorithms, sequential approaches to hypothesis testing, and really treat the design of experiments problem as the major focus where everyone else just skips that and thinks about how to build the best predictive model

Moving to eBay as a Data Science Analyst?,1ck5fiy,"Hey all, firstly, I don't want to sound disingenuous so I really hope this doesn't come off that way.

I have a pretty non-traditional path to Data Science, I did a Bachelor of Commerce, and through a rotation program at a big Canadian bank got into a Data Science team, that was supportive and took me on despite me lacking technicals.

I've been in the position now for 2 years, mostly working with NLP and unstructured data. Doing usual Power BI dashboard, KPI antics, all the way up to using transformer embeddings for email classification models. It has been a cool role, sadly plagued with bad management, and all at a slow bank.

In recent times, the bank has gone through reorg, and we (data and analytics team)  do not have the support from senior management, nor the funding that we did maybe even a year ago. Layoffs are a small possibility, but already I feel like we have been brushed to side, with not much expectations, nor no net new projects.

Furthermore, my boss who had hired me might also be leaving, meaning I would be stuck with completely non-technical management, and I would learn nothing.

Perhaps the one good thing is the pay, but that is making it hard for me to now find a new role. My current pay is around $95K CAD + last year, a 15% bonus. With new leadership now though, that doesn't support us, I doubt we will get a bonus as fat as that anymore.

I have been interviewing with eBay for a Data Science Analyst position, working on their item buying page, and got the offer yesterday. I would report to a team in SF, but would be based in Canada. The role would be less model-building, a lot more A/B testing, from what I gathered.

**Pros of eBay:**

* Data Science at Tech company gives validity to my otherwise non-technical resume (academically, at least)
* 1 week in office and flexibility to work from abroad (according to HR); so I can travel home internationally and not burn PTO, compared to 3 in office and no flexibility currently
* Hopefully newer tech stack than the bank (fr we don't even have a SQL server set up here lmfao)
* Been with the bank for 3 years in various roles, really tired and fed up, so would be a good change and refresh
* 20K sign on for first year, 10K sign on second year, conditional to me staying for a year after receiving bonuses, in addition to equity discount purchase options, and $30K USD equity package (25%/year vest) in compensation

**Cons:**

* Only a 10% base-pay bump. Tech homies (though in SF) tell me to not settle for anything less than 20% bump between jobs.
* Not building models as much, which makes it more statistics-focused and less applied
* 80% focused on A/B testing from what I gathered
* Unsure of eBay market reputation these days, what are some companies that people end up working at after eBay?
* High rate of layoffs

In addition to all of this, I am interviewing with Intuit and Robinhood, both for more technical Data Science positions. Those would likely pay in the 120K-140K CAD range from what I understand, eBay would be at 105k.

The next step for these interviews would be the technicals, which I do not feel confident for at all (Python, SQL LeetCode Mediums + statistics and ML design questions). I haven't studied for this stuff that much, and would really be cramming.

I have told eBay that I can let them know on Monday if the compensation is okay, I am tempted to go back to them and beg for $110K CAD, which would be a 15% bump, and mention that I am interested in the role, but the pay is just not working for me, especially that I am interviewing for two other positions that may pay better. So I want to request if I can continue the interview process with the other two, and get back to eBay with a final confirmation. Not sure how to phrase this, or if I should even show my hand like that.  
eBay HR was really nice, really felt like they were gunning for me, and the offer felt like the max they could squeeze out between Payroll and the Hiring team.

I'm just confused. In light of all of this, where can/should I go?

I was 65% in favour to take, 35% to reject, but given my friends/family advice that the pay is low and not worth moving, I am unsure.

I'm also not sure how to buy myself time for the interveiws with RH and Intuit, and god if I can even do them.

Is it really that bad to move for 10% base bump? Ignoring sign-on bonus, equity, quality of life?

Lastly, I'm not sure if eBay is a boost to my career or a step down; is it a good place to work? Is it frowned upon by other companies as a ""legacy tech company"" or something?

Put my foot down and refused to go ahead with what would amount to almost 8 hours of interviews for a senior data scientist position.,1cjdhdz,"I initially was  going to have a quick call (20 minutes) with a recruiter that ended up taking almost 45 minutes where I feel I was grilled enough on my background, it wasn't just do you know, x,y and z? They delved much deeper, which is fine, I suppose it helps figuring out right away if the candidate has at least the specific knowledge before they try to test it. But after that the recruiter stated that the interview process was over several days, as they like to go quick:

 - 1.5 hours long interview with the HM
 - 1.5 hours long interview focusing on coding + general data science.
 - 1.5 hours long interview focusing on machine learning.
 - 1.5 hour long interview with the entire team, general aspect questions.
 - 1 hour long interview with the VP of data science.


So between the 7 hours and the initial 45 minutes, I am expected to miss the equivalent of an entire day of work, so they can ask me unclear questions or on issues unrelated to work.


I told the recruiter, I need to bow out and this is too much. It would feel like I insulted the entire lineage of the company after I said that. They started talking about how that's their process, and it is the same for all companies to require this sort of vetting.

However, the client (I'm a consultant) uses SAS miner and guide, and does not use Python at all. Partially because they always have and partially for security concerns.

How to transition to machine learning engineering?,1cht1xs,"Im currently at a small tech consulting company. I have a master’s in data science but not much hard engineering experience.

 I’ve built 1 production system but it was still ‘low tech’. I was using excel files and then an AutoML tool and running time series forecasting offline at a regular cadence. But that project is done and it looks like clients I work with are all low tech and having to deploy anything with them seems like a pain. I work on POCs for ML modeling nowadays

I want to transition to a company where I can be on a better path and eventually try to be a software engineer in ML or an MLE. Finding opportunities to advance my skills are hard. I am currently interviewing at a company but the role seems more client focused and POC focused with maybe some opportunities to deploy / monitor ML systems. I am a little nervous that switching into a role that is not advertised as engineering heavy could be the wrong move

However, any company that works at large scale is probably better than what I do now. Any proper tech company where I can use proper tools like pyspark, databricks, etc seem like would put me in the path to do more engineering or ML at scale. 

I am curious what people think. What is the best way to break into MLE if you dont have large scale software experience and if your current best new role opportunities are not exactly engineering heavy but could have chances to build internal tools and deploy things sometimes? 

Personally I think I’ll try to do as much engineering work as possible in any new tech company that operates at sufficient scale. And maybe even gunning for an internal transfer to SWE / MLE if that ever shows up could be a move (and this has a chance of happening at new company not current one). And I’ll build some ML apps for personal projects as well. It seems like staying at a small consulting company will continue to hurt my long term skillsets since I don’t have exposure to proper tools and large scaled problems

Classification - using both euclidean distance and cosine similarity for inference,1chmmf3,"Context
- existing label split into 3 sub labels
- labeled historical data for existing label exists, but none for the 3 new sub labels
- idea is to use sub label description to get labeled data for the 3 sub labels
- but won't be able to get a lot of labeled data (because taggers actual role isn't to do tagging)

Given a query document, inference can be done
- option 1: using binary classifier for each sub label
- option 2: use label of the document nearest to the query document to predict label of query document
- option 3: use similarity between sub label description and query document to predict label of query document
- option 4: combination of options 2 and 3

Option 1 may not be ideal as the amount of labeled data for sub labels will likely not yield performant binary classifiers. If they don't fulfil the metrics set by stakeholders, they shouldn't be deployed which is where options 2, 3 and 4 came about. 

Option 2 is one shot classification using euclidean distance. It's opportunistic because it'll predict the sub labels if taggers had labeled the nearest document with the sub labels. 

Option 3 is zero shot classification using cosine similarity, because it doesn't rely on any historical documents to make prediction.

Option 4 mitigates the opportunistic factor of option 2 by allowing another similarity measure (option 3) to influence the prediction of the query document. This is the option I'm leaning towards should option 1 not meet stakeholders' expectations.

What would you call a model that by nature is a feedback loop?,1cgvuy3,"So, I'm hoping someone could help me find some reading on a situation I'm dealing with. Even if that's just by providing a name for what the system is called it would be very helpful. My colleagues and I have identified a general concept at work but we're having a hard time figuring out what it's called so that we can research the implications.

tl;dr - what is this called?

1. Daily updated model with a static variable in it creates predictions of rent 
2. Predictions of rent are disseminated to managers in field to target as goal
3. When units are rented the rate is fed back into the system and used as an outcome variable
4. During this time a static predictor variable is in the model and it because it continuously contributes to the predictions, it becomes a proxy for the outcome variable

&#x200B;

I'm working on a model of rents for my employer. I've been calling the model incestuous as what happens is the model creates predictions for rents, those predictions are sent to the field where managers attempt to get said rents for a given unit. When a unit is filled the rent they captured goes back into the database where it becomes the outcome variable for the model that predicted the target rent in the first place. I'm not sure how closely the managers adhere to the predictions but my understanding is it's definitely something they take seriously.

If that situation is not sticky enough, in the model I'm updating the single family residence variables are from 2022 and have been in the model since then. The reason being, extracting it like trying to take out a bad tooth in the 1860s. When we try to replace it with more recent data it hammers goodness of fit metrics. Enough so that my boss questions why we would update it if we're only getting accuracy that's about as good as before. So I decided just to try every combination of every year of zillow data 2020 forward. Basically just throw everything at the wall and surely out of 44 combinations something will be better. That stupid 2022 variable and its cousin 21-22 growth were at the top as measured by R-Squared and AIC.

So a few days ago my colleagues and I had an idea. This variable has informed every price prediction for the past two years. Since it was introduced it has been creating our rent variable. And that's what we're predicting. The reason why it's so good at predicting is that *it is a proxy for the outcome variable*. So I split the data up by moveins in 22, 23, 24 (rent doesn't move much for in place tenants in our communities) and checked the correlation between the home values 22 variable and rent in each of those subsets. If it's a proxy for quality of neighborhoods, wealth, etc then it should be strongest in 22 and then decrease from there. Of course... it did the exact opposite.

So at this point I'm convinced this variable is, mildly put, quite wonky. I think we have to rip the bandaid off even if the model is technically worse off and instead have this thing draw from a SQL table that's updated as new data is released. Based on how much that correlation was increasing from 22 to 24, eventually this variable will become so powerful it's going to join Skynet and target us with our own weapons. But the only way to ensure buy in from my boss is to make myself a mini-expert on what's going on so I can make the strongest case possible. And unfortunately I don't even know what to call this system we believe we've identified. So I can't do my homework here. 

We've alternately been calling it self-referential, recursive, feedback loop, etc. but none of those are yielding information.

"Anybody here transition away from DS and ML into adjacent roles like data engineereing, MLOps, analytics engineering, etc? Why did you transition and do you regret it?",1cg40nl,"Hi good folks of r/datascience . Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I am kind of at an impasse in my career right now. I work as a ML engineer looking to leave my current employer soon. I realized in the past year or so, that I actually dislike the modeling/stats part of it all and enjoy engineering. I have degrees in math and stats, and gotten good grades, so it's not like I am bad at it. And I actually liked these in school. But in my career, I am not really enjoying that aspect anymore, and want to just focus on engineering and building stuff. I no longer care about reading up on statistical models and ML papers. I get that Attention is all I need, but I no longer care to pay attention to Attention, if you get my drift.

So I am looking to leave data science and ML and pivot towards an adjacent engineering role, something like data engineering, MLOps, analytics engineering, platform engineering and the like. At the same time, I feel like AI/ML is the future and will explode in demand very soon, if it isn't already there. Perhaps it's fomo or feeling that my education in math/stats have gone to waste, but there is a part of me that feels like I am downgrading or moving down the career ladder by doing this. I also see most people trying to move \*towards\* ML so I feel like I am doing something wrong by making such a move.

I am wondering if anybody has faced something similar before and pivoted completely towards engineering rather than the ML model development and stats side (e.g. the ""sexy"" parts of data science). If you did, I would like to hear your story. What made you transition to an engineering focus? And do you regret it? Do you think you will eventually go back to ML/AI side or stay in engineering?

[NLP] Detect news headlines at the intersection of Culture & Technology,1cfvts1,"Hi nerds!

I’m a web dev with 10YoE and for the first time I’m working on a NLP project from scratch so… I’m in need of some wisdom.

Here's my goal : **detect news headlines at the intersection of Culture and Technology**.   

For example:
- VR usage in museums
- AI art (in music, movies, litterature etc)
- digital creativity
- cultural heritage & tech
- VC funding in the creativity space
- … you get the idea.

I've built Django app, scraping a ton of data from hundreds of RSS feeds in this space, but it’s not labeled or anything and there’s a lot of irrelevant noise. The intersection of Culture and Technology is rare, and also blurry because the concept of ""Culture"" is hard to catch.

I figured I need to create a ML classifier for news headlines, so as a first step I have manually labeled ~300 news headlines as revelant - to use as training data.

Now I'm experimenting with scikit-learn to build the classifier but I have really no idea what I'm doing.

My questions are:
1. Do you think my approach makes sense (manually labeling + training a ML classifier on top)
2. Do you have any recommendation regarding the type of classifier and the tools to build it ?
3. Do you know any dataset that could help me      
4. Do you have any advice in general for a rookie like me

I just feel like coursework is solving the most trivial useless things by hand and then not actually doing anything hands on. I’m in a masters stats position program and even though I’m doing well in the coursework, I rarely get to actually “DO” any of the things I’m learning. 

Like for example in my statistical inference theory class we spend like a week covering how to find rejection regions for hypothesis tests by hand using likelihood ratio tests, and then just do these derivations constantly. Same in my bayes class.

For example, the course I enjoy the most so far is my data visualization class because we are actually building a dashboard, and it made me realize how much I need to sharpen up my data cleaning skills. Being in theory classes for years in undergrad and now in grad school It was a huge wake up call to practice the basics outside of class.

Lately, I have been reading the research posted by tech companies, where they talk about what data scientists are doing out there in the real world, and the statistical methods that are being created and leveraged, and they are actually putting what they learn into practice and get so much creativity and freedom.

I’m frankly just looking forward to graduate and work because I’m so tired of not actually doing the real stuff and solving real problems. I’m hoping there’s more creativity fostered as oppose to a classroom. Does anyone feel this way about masters programs sometimes?

Seeking feedback on project scoping,1cfnvnx,"Can I get your feedback on some scoping work?

My task is to assess the accuracy of a system that calculates payments for invoices. It's an open-ended request for rough-and-ready insights. I am thinking through the analytical approach while waiting for data.

The complex payment policies make it impractical to independently validate individual payments at scale, so I can't directly label the payments as correct or incorrect. Instead I plan to characterize payment distributions and work with SMEs to distinguish those that fall in plausible and implausible ranges. I imagine a linear regression that controls for known payment drivers (e.g., type and quantity of services), enabling me to interpret large residuals as anomalous payments.

After this initial pass, I would work with SMEs to hypothesize causes for implausible payments and extract features to capture those causes (e.g., a flag for invoices that later had to be corrected). Then I would try to use these features to cluster implausible cases or separate them from plausible ones. The goal would be an interpretable model that highlights common scenarios causing payment anomalies.

Roast my Startup Idea - Tableau Version Control,1cftuh0,"Ok, so I currently work as a Tableau Developer/Data Analyst and I thought of a really cool business idea, born out of issues that I've encountered working on a Tableau team.

For those that don't know, Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence tool. PowerBI is its main competitor.

So, there is currently no version control capabilities in Tableau. The closest thing they have is *version history,* which just lets you revert a dashboard to a previously uploaded one. This is only useful if something breaks and you want to ditch all of your new changes.

.twb and .twbx (Tableau workbook files) are actually XML files under the hood. This means that you technically can throw them into GitHub to do version control with, there are certain aspects of ""merging"" features/things on a dashboard that would break the file. Also, there is no visual aspect to these merges, so you can't see what the dashboard would look like after you merge them.

Collaboration is another aspect that is severely lacking. If 2 people wanted to work on the same workbook, one would literally have to email their version to the other person, and the other person would have to manually rectify the changes between the 2 files. In terms of version control, Tableau is in the dark ages.

I'm not entirely sure how technically possible it would be to create a version control software based on the underlying XML, but based on what I've seen so far from the XML structure, it seems possible

Disclaimer, I am not currently working on this idea, I just thought of it and want to know what you think.

The business model would be B2B and it would be a SaaS business. Tableau teams would acquire/use this software the same way they use any other enterprise programming tool.

For the companies and teams that do use Tableau Server already, I think this would be a pretty reasonable and logical next purchase for their org. The target market for sales would be directors and managers who have the influence and ability to purchase software for their teams. The target users of the software would be tableau developers, data analysts, business intelligence developer, or really anyone who does any sort of reporting or visualization in Tableau.

My salary is in the low 70s and I work fully remotely (don’t live with parents). I really love the team I work with, the work is fairly easy and stress-free, and the work-life balance is amazing.

I recently received an offer at a large health insurance company as a data analyst in a new grad rotational program. This offer is hybrid (2 days remote 3 days in-office) and pays in the high 70s + a variable yearly bonus. The office is 1 mile from where I live and I could walk or take 1 bus ride. There's a promotion and chance of full remote work depending on the team I join when the 1-year rotational program ends. This role aligns more with my career goals of becoming a data scientist and seems like I’d have more opportunities for career growth in the long run.

I’m having a hard time deciding whether to take this new role.

The Two Step SCM: A Tool for Data Scientists,1ce0ezw,"To data scientists who work in Python and causal inference, you may find the two-step synthetic control method helpful. It is a method developed by Kathy Li of Texas McCombs. I have written it from her MATLAB code, translating it into Python so more people can use it.

The method tests the validity of different parallel trends assumptions implied by different SCMs (the intercept, summation of weights, or both). It uses subsampling (or bootstrapping) to test these different assumptions. Based off the results of the null hypothesis test (that is, the validity of the convex hull) implements the recommended SCM model.

The page and [code](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth/blob/main/TSSC/TSSCVignette.md) is still under development (I still need to program the confidence intervals). However, it is generally ready for you to work with, should you wish. Please, if you have thoughts or suggestions, comment here or email me.

LLMs: Why does in-context learning work? What exactly is happening from a technical perspective?,1cdii27,"Everywhere I look for the answer to this question, the responses do little more than anthropomorphize the model. They invariably make claims like:

> *Without examples, the model must infer context and rely on its knowledge to deduce what is expected. This could lead to misunderstandings.*

> *One-shot prompting reduces this cognitive load by offering a specific example, helping to anchor the model's interpretation and focus on a narrower task with clearer expectations.*

> *The example serves as a reference or hint for the model, helping it understand the type of response you are seeking and triggering memories of similar instances during training.*

> *Providing an example allows the model to identify a pattern or structure to replicate. It establishes a cue for the model to align with, reducing the guesswork inherent in zero-shot scenarios.*

These are real excerpts, btw.

But these models don’t “understand” anything. They don’t “deduce”, or “interpret”, or “focus”, or “remember training”, or “make guesses”, or have literal “cognitive load”. They are just statistical token generators. Therefore pop-sci explanations like these are kind of meaningless when seeking a concrete understanding of the exact mechanism by which in-context learning improves accuracy.

Can someone offer an explanation that explains things in terms of the actual model architecture/mechanisms and how the provision of additional context leads to better output? I can “talk the talk”, so spare no technical detail please.

I could make an educated guess - Including examples in the input which use tokens that approximate the kind of output you want leads the attention mechanism and final dense layer to weight more highly tokens which are similar in some way to these examples, increasing the odds that these desired tokens will be sampled at the end of each forward pass; like fundamentally I’d guess it’s a similarity/distance thing, where explicitly exemplifying the output I want increases the odds that the output get will be similar to it - but I’d prefer to hear it from someone else with deep knowledge of these models and mechanisms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cdii27/llms_why_does_incontext_learning_work_what/,synthphreak,51,ML,39,Hot

We run an online sales portal with a multitude of variables that can lead to changes in our KPIs. A lot of the functioning of these variables are not well documented.

To look or not to look for a new job,1cc3pqe,"

I have been recently contemplating whether to look for a new job or not. I read somewhere to make a pros and cons list to figure out if I should. Here is my list, looking for some constructive feedback.

Pros:

* Job Security in an uncertain economy.
* Recently got promoted to senior DS, direct manager responsible for pushing for promotion.
* Work from home and pretty flexible working hours.
* Moved to a low cost city, but current salary based on high COL city.
* Some really good technical teammates to learn new technologies from, unfortunately they do not want to be managers, but prefer to be senior level ICs.
* Generally treated as a high performer.
* Slim chance of promotion if team members leave.
* Kids wouldn't have to move again, good school district.

Cons:

* Company financials not looking good, cash infusion from board, C-level suite revamped.
* No more merit based increases in the foreseeable future, freezing hire. No more promotions or career growth until company stabilizes.
* Direct Manager (female) was effectively stripped of role in departmental restructuring.
* Skip Manager (male) was initially not supportive of promotion and now is direct manager.
* Career growth looks non-existent, especially as a female, skip manager effectively made all white male middle managers during reorg.
* Working at fintech, there is not much innovation in terms of modeling, stuck with binary classification (default prediction) most of the time.
* Good at and interested in improving MLOps /MLE work (deploying models and improving infrastructure), but skip manager effectively delegated the women in the team to model delivery and put all the men in technical work. Also doesn’t recognize technical skillset.
* Looking for a new job would mean lower salaries based on general trend and recently moving to a low COL city.
* General dread of being typecast in fintech space with not a lot of exposure to other modeling techniques.
* Team culture is non-existent, especially with surviving 3 RIFs at company, and many key folks that held up the culture, leaving.
* Even after doing a good job of building responsible models that drive the core of the business, financials were not controlled correctly, leading to a lot of uncertainty in company future.
* Afraid of being the last one left, generally prefer to not change jobs often due to being on work visa , but also need the company to do well for security.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cc3pqe/to_look_or_not_to_look_for_a_new_job/,dsgirlie,1,Career Discussion,21,Hot

Why Aren't Boilerplates More Common in DS?,1cb3p6o,"I've been working as a DS in predictive analytics a good amount of years now, and recently I've been pushed to dig a bit more on the more data viz side, which eeeehh fortunately or unfortunately meant coding web-dev stuff.

Discussion: AI for data science,1casob4,"**Do you think that AI can help data science teams beyond just ""ask data / text2sql"" chatbots?**

I've been in DS for a while, both as an IC and now as a lead. Despite improvements in analytics tools and workflows, getting to meaningful insights is still a very labor intensive and code heavy process. It especially takes a significant time to perform exploratory/foundational analysis, which can limit the ability to tackle more specialized problems and also increases the risk of overlooking something entirely.

I've been building something to address this, here's the elevator pitch: **an autonomous AI data scientist that proactively explores data, discovers insights, and presents findings in plain English**. This will give data teams an advantage by discovering core insights faster and pinpointing precisely where to initiate more in-depth analysis.

I have an MVP that can do what I am promising - users can connect/upload data and the product will iteratively plan, perform analysis, and interpret the results, each time summarizing findings into key themes. Under the hood, I'm using LLMs to orchestrate analysis and interpret results but using robust data science pipelines to perform the actual analysis. Accuracy and reliability is at the core.

I'm curious about the community's thoughts on this problem and my approach for a solution. Am I onto something or do I have it wrong?

* How much time do you/your teams spend on foundational analysis compared to deeper problem-solving or modeling?
* Is time often a limiting factor to how much you can explore before committing to a certain analysis path?

Am I a coding Imposter?,1c8ru38,"Hello DS fellows,

I've been working in the Data Science space for 7+ years now (was in a different career before that).  However, I continue to feel very inadequate to the point that I constantly have this imposter syndrome about my coding skills that I want to ask for your opinions/feedback.

Despite my 7+ years of writing codes and scripting in Python, I still have to look up the syntax 70% - 80% of the times on the internet when I do my projects.  The problem is that I have hard time remembering the syntax.  Because of this, most of the times I just copy and paste code chunks from my previous works and then modify them;  yet even when doing modification I still have to look up the syntax on the internet if something new is needed to add.

I have coded in C and C++ in the past and I suffered the same problem but it was for short periods of time so I didn't think anything about it back then.

Besides this, I don't have any issues with solving complicated problems because I tend to understand the math/stats very well and derive solution plans for them.  But when it comes to coding it up, I find myself looking up the syntax too often even when I have been using Python for 7+ years now (average about 1-2 coding times per week).

I feel very embarrassed about this particular short-coming and want to ask 2 questions:

1. Is this normal for those with similar length of experience?
2. If this is not normal, how can I improve?

Appreciate the responses and feedbacks!

=========  
**Update:**  Thanks everyone for your responses.  This now seems like a common problem for most.  To clarify, I don't need to look up simple syntax when coding in Python.

Less Weighting to assign to outliers in  time series forecasting?,1c99xba,"Hi data scientists here, 

I've tried to ask my colleagues at work but seems I didn't find the right group of people. We use time series forecasting , specifically Facebook Prophet , to forecast revenue. The revenue is similar to data packages with a telecom provided to customers. With certain subscriptions we have seen huge spike because of hacked accounts hence outliers, and they are 99% one time phenomenon. Another kind of outliers come from users who ramp their usage occasionally 

Does FB Prophet have a mechanism to assign very little weight to outliers? I thought there's some theory in probablities which says the probability of a certain random variable  being further away from a specific number converges to zero. (Weak law of large number) . So can't we assign a very little weight to those dots that are very far from the mean (i.e. large variance) or below a certain probability ?

Need advice on my NLP project,1c8oy2r,"It’s been about 5 years since I worked on NLP. I’m looking for some general advice on the current state of NLP tools (available in Python and well established) that can help me explore my use case quickly before committing long-term effort. 

Here’s my problem:

- Classifying customer service transcriptions into one of two classes.

- The domain is highly specific, i.e unique lingo, meaningful words or topics that may be meaningless outside the domain, special phrases, etc. 

- The raw text is noisy, i.e line breaks and other HTML formatting, jargon, multiple ways to express the same thing, etc. 

- Transcriptions will be scored in a batch process and not real time.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

- A simple and effective NLP workflow for initial exploration of the problem that can eventually scale.

- Advice on current NLP tools that are readily available in Python, easy to use, adaptable, and secure.

- Advice on whether pre-trained word embeddings make sense given the uniqueness of the domain.

"Sampling from a large, not independent dataset  ",1c8jbrm,"So I’m building a simple regression model to predict fuel consumption for trucks in a large food company. We have data from different trips  from different routes. 

Some routes have much more trips and are thus over represented in the data. Let’s say as an example that we have 10 routes, with 8 routes having 10 individual trips and 1 route having 1000 trips. If I would just randomly sample the data most of the data would come from the large route, reducing the regression problem to basically fitting that specific route. 

Now that isn’t something we want because we would like to take into account different geographic information from the various routes (a route has a number of geographic and specific features). Should I just perform stratified sampling? 

This brings me to our second problem, that the different trips won’t be independent. If I sample 10 trips from the large route then all the input variables unique for the route will all be the same, having only variability in trip specific features such as time of day or weight of the freight. How should we account for this? Using a hierarchical model maybe?

Data Scientist: job preparation guide 2024,1c7aqn0,"I have been hunting jobs for almost 4 months now. It was after 2 years, that I opened my eyes to the outside world and in the beginning, the world fell apart because I wasn't aware of how much the industry has changed and genAI and LLMs were now mandatory things. Before, I was just limited to using chatGPT as UI. 

So, after preparing for so many months it felt as if I was walking in circles and running across here and there without an in-depth understanding of things. I went through around 40+ job posts and studied their requirements, (for a medium seniority DS position).

Data Science is fun!,1c7bw30,"Hi everyone, I’m a marketing major about to graduate in May. A year and a half ago I took basic hypothesis testing/linear modeling class to try out an analytics certificate at my school, and I fell in love with statistics for the first time. When I began looking for job/internship opportunities around that time I was worried because while I didn’t mind marketing, I also didn’t love it. That’s when I made the decision to continue my degree in business, and work every week towards becoming a data analyst (and eventually, a data scientist! But I’m patient, and I wanted to wait until I’m ready. There’s a lot to statistics/programming, as I now know… lol). 

It’s been a long and *very* hard road. But I now have a job as a data analyst and I’m working on a large machine learning personal project now. I see a lot of negative discussion in this sub (which is entirely fair); however, I just wanted you all to know that as someone who is not taking the traditional route into data science, I think your job is awesome.

How big of a jump is it from Data Scientist to ML Engineer?,1c79bse,"I'm considering applying for a Machine Learning Engineer position with my company. I already work as a Data Scientist. I've developed a great reputation and most of the executives know who I am and frequently ask for my input on things. I'm happy with my job, but unfortunately, it feels a bit dead-end'ish. It's a great job, don't get me wrong, but I don't see any obvious path to promotion, short of waiting it out 10 years and that frustrates me a lot. 

There are more long-term opportunities in ML Engineering in my company. Salary should be a bit higher as well; I'm estimating I'd make at least $25k more. 

As a DS, I mostly work with Python, SQL, and Tableau. I'd say only about 20% of my time is spent coding, however. I've built a few machine learning models (mostly time-series and collaborative filtering), but it's not the main crux of what I do. Still, I'm pretty universally regarded as the expert on ML as well as tech on the team. Moreover, I've automated a lot of our analysis. I'd be considered an expert on SQL and data analysis, as well. 

If I switch to MLE, I'd also need to become proficient in Databricks, Azure, and React. I don't work with any of those on a regular basis (I've used Azure and Databricks before, but not a lot). I'm guessing I'd probably go from coding maybe 20% of the time to coding 70%+ of the time, as well. React is probably the toughest one there, but I do have front-end experience from working as a full-stack developer at a start-up a few years back; albeit, I'd consider myself very far from an expert on front-end. 

I'd be very good at it, but I admit it might take me 1-2 months to ""get into a groove"" and get comfortable with some of the technologies I'm less familiar with, particularly React. I learn quickly, but I often feel like people want take a chance on anyone who doesn't already know every skill in the job requirement. 

My questions:

**How big of a jump is this?** I don't use Databricks on a regular basis, but given my proficiency in Python and SQL, is that going to be something that would take a long time to get familiar with? Is my relative inexperience in React a big issue or is it just so difficult to find an ML Engineer with React experience to begin with, that I might get a pass on that? 

**Is it worthwhile?** Anyone who has worked on both the business-facing DS side and the more tech-oriented ML side, did you enjoy one more than the other? 

**Am I likely to get serious consideration?** I have a very good reputation within the company, but often feels like some of the more pure tech people look down on someone more business-facing like myself. I'm not sure how I'll be perceived, since my background was business before I got into tech.

Developments outside the world of LLMs and GenAI,1c7k28c," Hi everyone, 

I want to know if there are developments and research topics that are outside/completely orthogonal to LLMs and generative AI. To be honest, I am **bored** of LLMs. I don't care about the performance of Model X vs Models A,B,C,D etc. Moreover, at least 8 out of 10 projects in my organization are focused on generative AI and RAG. While I understand the usefulness of these ideas, I think there's an overload of information that is not particularly helpful for my brain.

Personally, I am interested in scientific machine learning- drug discovery, climate change, physics simulations. If there are other research areas that you are aware of, please feel free to share. 

From a ""long term career perspective"", I want to transition to companies that work on problems in imaging and communications (I have a background in signal/image processing and computer vision). I am very much interested in novel imaging techniques that use some kind of computational imaging and ML algorithms.

Imputation methods satisfying constraints,1c7xt1z,"Hey everyone,

I have here a dataset of KPI metrics from various social media posts. For those of you lucky enough to not be working in digital marketing, the metrics in question are things like:

* ""impressions"" (number of times a post has been seen)
* ""reach"" (number of unique accounts who have seen a post) 
* ""clicks"", ""comments"", ""likes"", ""shares"", etc (self-explanatory)

The dataset in question is incomplete, the missing values are distributed across pretty much every dimension, and my job is to develop a model to fill in those missing values. So far I've tested a KNN imputer with some success, as well as an Iterative imputer (MICE) with much better results. 

But there's 1 problem that persists: some values need to be constrained by others in the same entry. Imagine for instance that a given post had 55 ""Impressions"", meaning that it has been seen 55 times, and we try to fill the missing ""Reach"" (number of unique accounts that have seen that post). Obviously that amount cannot be higher than 55. A post cannot be viewed 55 times by 60 different accounts. There are a bunch of such constraints that I somehow need to pass in to my model, I've tried looking into the MICE algorithm to find an answer there but without success. 

Does anyone know of a way I can enforce these types of constraints? Or is there another data imputation method that's better suited for this type of task?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c7xt1z/imputation_methods_satisfying_constraints/,Antoinefdu,2,Analysis,5,Hot

Job hunt update.,1c6p6m4,"I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/s/5MjMTDtBYB) after getting an offer a couple months ago. A couple weeks after the offer, it was rescinded. Probably for the best as I realized the original description did not match the actual role.

After the offer was rescinded, I took a couple weeks off the job hunt before getting back at it. Cleaned up the resume, started being more selective with where I applied, and grinding SQL problems online. About a month in I was interviewing with 3 companies. 

I don't feel like making another Sankey, but it's pretty much identical to the last, except I got 3 first round interviews, rather than the 1 last time. Companies are 1 mid-sized tech and 2 pre-IPO unicorns. I was ghosted by one unicorn after a screening round and am still interviewing with the other after 2 rounds, though after 5 rounds with the mid-sized tech I accepted a DS manager position.

My advice: 1) stop following this subreddit, it's 90% doom posting and 10% circle jerk. It doesn't feel like anyone here is actually interested in data science beyond getting a job. 2) mass send an easy to parse resume everywhere. 3) keep your head up, it's a grind. Don't forget to exercise, eat well, and have a social outlet. 4) referrals aren't worth what they once were. None of my dozen or so referrals resulted in even a screening interview 

I was rejected for roles I thought I was a shoo-in for and interviewed for roles I thought were a reach. There's a lot of luck (preparation+opportunity) involved that's often out of your control.

How much does the topic of a MS Stat thesis matter when hiring? ,1c7mn25,"I’m going to be starting my Masters Thesis in my stats program. I have narrowed down two projects with different faculty members. One of them is entirely self guided, and that advisor doesn’t really have any expertise in this area and the other one is basically with another faculty member but the research topic is within his domain, so he can help me, but the application strays too far from what industry I want to be in.

Project 1:  Causal Machine Learning, and nonparametric estimation for identifying heterogenous treatment effects in advertising/marketing data. 

There’s a dataset by a company in the marketing/adtech space that they have made public, and is essentially an open dataset related to shopping transactions, and demographics of shoppers, and information on marketing campaigns that were run by the company. 

Ideally this would be a causal inference project, where I get to actually learn causal inference and causal (double) machine learning on my own, and apply it to this dataset. No new methods being created, just a standalone causal inference analysis and basically I walk away with learning a new area of statistics and a way to solve causal problems. 

My advisors background is nonparametric regression so he would be able to give me advice on the estimators being used (some of the methods use random forests, tree based methods, splines, kernel methods etc.) so he could be of help in that sense. But he knows nothing about causal inference. So I’d be on my own on this one.

I want to take on this project despite it being quite isolated because I want to signal to my future employer that I can work on data science problems involving causal inference.
 
I only have 1 year, so id have to self learn causal inference + do the analysis + the paper. 

Project 2: Bayesian Dimension Reduction in gene expression data

Another advisor works in the area of dimension reduction, and broadly works in genomics. The project he was proposing for me was an actual opportunity to create some new methods. So much more on the research side than doing an analysis like project 1. 

It involves looking at Bayesian approaches to doing common dimension reduction techniques like PCA, Factor Analysis etc.

From this paper I’d walk away with a good opporuntity to  dive deeper into Bayesian inference, and work on methods research. I’ve never done a bayes project before, despite just taking a class on it.

The cons to this is I don’t really have any interest working in bioinformatics, but this research is within the realm of my advisor so he can actually help me. The other con, is I don’t want my future employer to think I’m not qualified for tasks involving causal inference because I worked on dimension reduction, and with applications to genetic data, which is not really the industry I want to be in. 


Does anyone have any input on this? Does choosing a topic not related to causal inference lessen my chances of getting a job involving that? Do people care what my thesis topic is? Or does the MS in Stats signal that I could work on causal inference?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c7mn25/how_much_does_the_topic_of_a_ms_stat_thesis/,Direct-Touch469,0,Discussion,18,Hot

Career advice regarding role transition.,1c75tlv,"I am currently a data scientist in a big bank. Overall my experience in my team was hell.

Some of my experiences were
1) bad stakeholders that bad mouth the analytics team. Stakeholders are very pushy and thus 5-6 month projects are compressed into 2 months. Effective we have a stakeholder from hell, and has a reputation for lynching managers. One of the managers i was on good terms I worked with effectively got lynched for things outside of their control. 

2)  i had an old manager that bad mouthed me as we didnt work well together then left. Manager was very toxic however any achievement is an uphill battle.

3) i ended up having to work a lot of hours, however i tried to draw boundaries to my team and ended up getting reprimand and my manager was essentially making my life a living hell and then put me on a pip.

4) I got crap for taking a sick leave due to a surgery despite telling them 3-4 months in advance.

5)our turnover is bad, we lose 1 data scientist a year if not more. 

6) my new manager effectively helps my coworkers but tells me to figure it our and does not i include me in meetings that are critical for my project. After withholding that information, in my touchbases with the manager she then criticizes my work for information that she witheld. 

However lately, they really fixed their attitude as i had to work extra hours to meet their deadlines while still looking for jobs. As of now they started adding more projects and tasks for me while I am in a pip. 

My pip was 6 weeks, and the manager slipped up saying the 8 week process. 6 weeks pip-2 weeks to be fired.

My personal guess is that they realized that I am not as bad as I am essentially the model janitor who fixes other people mistakes and when anything goes wrong I get blamed for it. A model is performing poorly, go rebuild it. This model has no documentation go rebuild it. This senior manager built an outrageously bad dataset go build it. 

Also i know critical dataset info and my own new manager does not know a lot of stuff on our data sources. While doing my job i was doing my managers job as she had no clue how to get any data or the problems with it.

Now that I have another offer with slightly more pay, but working in a startup i am strongly rethinking of just giving them the FU and leaving myself. However startups are risky and its not as prestigious as the bank. The benefits/PTO are worse (despite not being able to cash out or use pto in my current job for a year 7.5 weeks of pto unused), also given the bonuses and etc. its actually worse as the startup offers a static bonus of 7500 with 95000 base with my current role is 90,900 with 10% bonus, however i can feel they will still overwork me but i am considered to be very technical and start fresh.
The role offers more finance opportunities specific to risk modeling rather than pricing which i dont know if it will have major applications in other industries.

My friend and family are saying that its not worth it. While my current job effectively makes me get panic attacks, insomnia for months (i wake up in the middle of the night from the stress), and also i stayed for weeks not eating from stress.

The job is hell, and now the tone on is slightly better but i really dont trust my team as I think

Sorry if this is sound unhinged, but i finally got a ticket out and I wanted professional advice on how I would approach this situation.

This Friday, I have an upcoming final-round interview with the Director of the division I'd be interning under if I got the position.

Per the recruiter, this is just to sort of solidify me as the right candidate for this role. I know that there won't be any sort of technical/coding aspect as it is just a 30-minute call.

If anyone has any advice on how to approach it, it would be greatly appreciated! This is my first ever final round interview so any advice would be great!

Thanks and have a great day!

EDIT:

I had the interview and I'll find out early next week the decision in regards to the internship. All I can say is that the final round is mainly about you and how you are/how you think as a person. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/articles/final-interview-questions) provides a really good list of questions you might be asked. In my case, I was asked about what I'd like to get out of the internship, how would I describe myself, if I've ever had a disagreement with someone on a project what was my course of action, and why do you specifically want to work for us. A bunch of behavioral stuff. 

I will say that the advice provided by u/Dangerous_Media_2218 and u/data_story_teller is super helpful in terms of what to ask in terms of the job. To all the people that provided advice, thank you so much.

Is there some sort of multilevel KNN/ML model I can use to figure out which users will buy specific products?,1c6c87p,"

I am wondering if there is some sort of multilevel model that I can use to identify likely buyers of specific products or create a lookalike audience.

The issue is that I have 1000s of products and around a million users. It would be computationally infeasible to create a model for every product.

"What are some good approaches to detect mislabeling/misclassification while being resilient to outliers, anomalies, and new emergent classes?",1c6c2da,"I'm working on a self-driven project where I'm taking data, clustering it using DBSCAN or OPTICS, and passing the data and labels to a classifier to train. The overall goal is anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and behavioral analysis and my approach has been to remove conserved (repeated) patterns as ""knowns"", provide a best-fit for anomalies under the assumption that the sample belongs to a known class but contains a type of anomaly (or is an outlier), and to flag unknown cases as either more prominent anomalies or, in cases where anomalies bear a measure of self-similarity, a new, emergent class.

Currently, I am using an ensemble of OVR binary classifiers (SVMs), each trained on a single target class against all other samples, as a recognition network. I also have a boosted ensemble (random forest) trained similarly to provide consensus to the output of the recognition system.

I have a k-NN classifier that is trained only on clustered data (samples labeled as noise by clustering was removed from this training set) to act as a rectification system for mislabeling/misclassification.

So, if a sample is passed through and there's a consensus in the recognition network, it can bypass the rectification system. If consensus is not met, the rectification system attempts to identify the class. If the probability is high enough, it's flagged as an anomaly of class N and sent out for further anomaly detection and isolation. If the rectification system's probability output is too low (or more than 1 label has a similar probability), it's flagged for analyst review.

Does this make sense? It works well in most cases but I don't quite have the warm and fuzzy on the misclassification detection. It seems kind of nebulous when it comes to recognizing a known class, an anomalous sample of a known class, a new class, or a variant/evolution/subclass of a known class. That's where I'm wanting to go with this.

Using Cloud Compute and Parallelization,1c5jwqv,"

I believe my next steps are working with a cloud computing service to offload my code onto stronger computers, as well as editing my code to make use of parallelization.

Does anyone have recommendations on services and/or resources for how to get started? I’m probably going to start looking into some sort of aws service (sagemaker?) and my friend mentioned dask to me, so I’ll look into that as well.

Right now my code is calling these models using the standard pipeline method within a list comprehension. I believe I’ll need to change that, as I’m expecting that to not be parallelizable.

"Real-time hypothesis testing, premature stopping ",1c4uvfr,"Say I want to start offering a discount for shopping in my store. I want to run a test to see if it's a cost-effective idea. I demand an improvement of $d in average sale $s to compensate for the cost of the discount. I start offering the discount randomly to every second customer. Given the average traffic in my store, I determine I should be running the experiment for at least 4 months to determine the true effect equal to d at alpha 0.05 with 0.8 power. 


1. Should my hypothesis be: 

H0: s_exp - s_ctrl < d

And then if I reject it means there's evidence the discount is cost effective (and so I start offering the discount to everyone) 

Or 

H0: s_exp - s_ctrl > d 

And then if I don't reject it means there's *no* evidence the discount is *not* cost effective (and so i keep offering the discount to everyone or at least to half of the clients to keep the test going)


2. What should I do if after four months, my test is not conclusive? All in all, I don't want to miss the opportunity to increase the profit margin, even if true effect is 1.01*d, right above the cost-effectiveness threshold. As opposed to pharmacology, there's no point in being too conservative in making business right? Can I keep running the test and avoid p-hacking?


3. I keep monitoring the average sales daily, to make sure the test is running well. When can I stop the experiment before preassumed amount of sample is collected, because the experimental group is performing very well or very bad and it seems I surely have enough evidence to decide now? How to avoid p-hacking with such early stopping?


Bonus 1: say I know a lot about my clients: salary, height, personality. How to keep refining what discount to offer based on individual characteristics? Maybe men taller than 2 meters should optimally receive two times higher discount for some unknown reasons?


Bonus 2: would bayesian hypothesis testing be better-suited in this setting? Why?

Instead it seemed like the employees would generate ideas and figure out how to engineer it. 

  
Where I'm going with this is that if you're trying to break into the field or stand out this is a great opportunity. the leadership typically doesn't know what use cases exist for AI or how to measure it. If you can sell yourself like this on a resume/interview it seems like a good way to stand out. So taking a AI application and use case from begining to end seems like a new potential backdoor to get some attention. Also showing that you're the guy that can provide a method to show that the use case is effective (since they don't yet know how to measure impact).

Recommendation for Coursera or Udemy courses?,1cmrvht,"Data Science undergrad here, just finished off my first year, and I'm looking to just improve technical skills. For programming, I primarily do Python, nothing too complex just yet, just cleaning, some simple clustering, and regressions. I do of course take maths classes and CS (Java) as minors.

However, I'm primarily looking for courses, I can take to just put me ahead of the curve. Especially for when I apply to internships later this year (for next year) and to help me build some nice projects to beef up and build a portfolio.

Any recommendations? Started an IBM Data Science course on Coursera, but it's been very underwhelming thus far, thought to maybe start looking at some python, and SQL courses on Udemy. 

I don't have a lot of money, but I do make about 100 or so a week from a Python Tutoring job that I can spend on premium courses.

Opportunity or Career Detriment?,1cmq1as,"To preface, I'm currently a Data Analyst with about 1 year of experience. My role is a remote position I'm relatively happy in: I get to work with statistical models and mostly program in R, Python, and a bit of Stata. 

However, the pay is low and recent family matters are pressuring me to bring in more $$$. 

Recently, I've been interviewing for a few positions (all Health Data/Biostats related). One of these positions is very desireable on paper. It's senior level, the pay is great, the cost of living in the area is very low, and the benefits would go a very long way for my family and I.

This position is, unfortunately, in the tobacco industry. My concern is that by working here, it may turn off future employers whenever I need to transition.

The company has stated that their focus is on hazard mitigation of the products, so I'd imagine my work would pertain to that. However, I still don't know if that would mitigate the negative perception   of the role.

"Technical Interview - Python, SQL, Problem but NOT Leetcode?",1cmnf0m,"I'm have technical interviews with a fintech company, and they (HR) have specifically told me that the interview will be on Problem Solving, SQL, and Python.

The position is for a Data Scientist, 2+ YOE.

I'm prepping by brushing up all my SQL, running through Ace the Data Science Interview for ML theory (and conceptual questions), and largely ignoring pure statistics/probabilities for now.

In a way, I'm thankful that it's not Leetcode because I suck ass at DS&A, but also I don't really know what to expect?

For the Python piece, I was thinking going over training models with sklearn (full pipeline, train-test-split, normalizatoin, scaling etc.), building some models from scratch (zzzz, linear regression, logistic regression), building some algorithms from scratch (cosine distance, bag of words, count vectorizer), pandas dataframe manipulation, numpy linear algebra.

Just wondering are there any ideas for what else I could expect? Is this list a good idea to prep?

Not sure if ""it WONT be Leetcode"" means, it will be DS&A just not problems from Leetcode, or it means nothing like DS&A at all.

Bootstrap Procedure for Max,1cmjlvx,"Hello my fellow DS/stats peeps,

I am working on a new problem where I am dealing with 15 years worth of hourly data of average website clicks. On a given day, I am interested in estimating the peak volume of clicks on a website with a 95% confidence interval. The way I am going about this is by bootstrapping my data 10,000 times for each day but I am not sure if I am doing this right or it might not even be possible.

Procedure looks as follows:

* Group all Jan 1, Jan 2,… Dec 31 into daily buckets. So I have 15 years worth of hourly data for each of these days, or 360 data points (15\*24).
* For a single day bucket (take Jan 1), I sample 24 values (to mimic the 24 hour day) from the 1/1 bucket to create a resampled day, store the max during each resampling. I do this process 10,000 times for each day.
   * At this point, I have 10,000 bootstrapped maxes for all days of the year.

This is where I get a little lost. If I take the .975 and .025 of the 10,000 bootstrapped maxes for each day, in theory these should be my 95% bands of where the max should live. When I bootstrap my max point estimate by taking the max of the 10,000 samples, it’s the same as my upper confidence band.

Am I missing something theoretical or maybe my procedure is off? I’ve never bootstrapped a max or maybe it is not something that is even recommended/possible to do.

So have received a take home exercise for a job interview that I am currently in the final stages of, and would really like to nail. The task is fairly simple and having eyeballed it I already know what I intend to do. However the task has provided me with a number of csv files to use in my analysis and subsequent presentation. However they have mentioned that I would be judged on my sql code. Granted I could probably do this faster in excel i.e. vlookups to simulate the joins I need to make to create the 'end table' etc however it seems like I will need to use the sql and will be getting partially judged on the cleanliness and integrity of my code. This too is not a problem and in my mind I already know what I would like to do. However all my experience is working in IDE's that my work has paid for. To complete this exercise I would need to load these csv files into a open source SQL IDE of some sort (or at least so I think). However I have no idea whats out there and what I should use. also I would ideally like to present this notebook style and sop suggestions where I could run commentary and code side by side a la colab that may be fit for purpose would be greatly appreciated. Do not have much time on the task but am ironically stumped where to start (even though I know exactly how to answer the question at hand)

Am I really a Data Analyst?,1clqh1h,"Hello everyone. It is my first post here, but I read this subreddit nearly each day as a way to understand more about this world. So, first of all, nice to contact you, dudes.

My question refers to the exact nature of the rol I am currently playing in a company. So, let me explain (TL;DR at the end of the post, here just the long explanation):

* **My background**: I'm a Psychology Bachelor, with two Ms. in Criminology and a third one in Methodology and Statistics. Contrary to the majority in my country (studying criminology in Spain is interesting, but it's horrible to find a job with that), I was able to enrole with a Computer Science research team from a very famous university in Spain, where I started analyzing online profiles to participate in research (both from a NLP and a bit of SNA perspective). As I was very very interested on Data Analysis and statistics (I'm not a very good statician, but at least I am really interested on it and happy to learn and study new things), they convinced me to do a PhD in Computer Science (which was focused on that topic, classic NLP and SNA to study social data online). With a lot of effort, I finished it and continued working on Academia till a year ago, when I was so burned out of several things of Spanish academia that I decided to start looking for new jobs. My environment always told me that my profile was quite interesting, but I had lot of problems trying to get interviews, as my profile is, as we say in Spain, ""an apprendice of everything, but master of none"" (I think that, in English, is "" Jack of *all trades*, *master of none* "". But, after a few months, I found a company focused on social data analysis projects that interviewed me and gave me an offer.
* **The original interview + offer**: they interviewed me for a Data Analyst position (nor junior, nor senior). The interview was a first one with HR, asking about my general CV, and then with a team manager and a ""senior"" data analyst. The interview was waaaaaaay too easy. They shared their screen and showed me a dataset on Excel, and asked me very simple things about it (e.g. what can you tell me about this pattern, what would you do to extract information from this couple of variables, how would you deal with missing data, etc). For me, it was a relief, as I've been working a lot at academia and wanted to have something easier to do, at least for some time. I guess they were interested on me, as they decided to gave me an offer (data analyst, 32K€, better salary than in academia, and FULL remote work, which was ideal for me since I prefered to go back from Madrid to a little city in the coast of Spain, with family and friends). I accepted without any doubts, and left academia.
* **The problem: I've been working three months for that company. In the beginning, I thought I would work as ""simple"" dat**a analyst on Excel (in, let's say, more or less ""structured"" projects). However, they told me that, due to my profile, they preferred me to be involved in ""innovation"" projects, which sounded interesting. On those projects, I'm working with a single manager, which is in contact with the client and tells me what type of analysis he wants on the pipeline, which I build in Python, translating every idea he tells me into ""regular"" analysis. For the built of that pipeline, I need knowledge on Python (they did not ask me to test my skills on Python during the interview), SQL (same), NLP (same), SNA (same), a little bit of PowerBI (same) and a little bit of Excel (this was the only thing covered). Also, each time I tell the manager that an analysis is too complicated and there is another way to deal with the idea he has, he always discards my idea and tells me to do it they way he wants. Most of the times, this means a lot of hours wasted, and no apologies. Also, another manager told me that he wanted me to ""guide"" the rest of the data analysts of the company, which are more junior than me, and structure a whole ""data analysis"" department. I thought that meant that I would work as a... lead data analyst? But they told me that was just dealing with internal projects with all the data analysts to improve general analysis for future projects. I said that was OK for me (I know is naive, but is my first data analyst job outside academia and, to be honest, I'm interested on leading a team). However, usually data analysts are required to be involved on company projects 110% of the time (most of the time doing extra hours), and this means that, each time I distribute work among us and we meet in 4-5 days, no one was able to advance on it due to other duties of the company (each manager wants their work to be absolute priority). Also, interestingly, the other data analysts do usually work with Excel and PowerBI, using Python just in rare occassions.

TL;DR: Bachelor in Psychology, 2 Ms. in Criminology, 1 Ms. in Statistics, PhD in Computer Science, low-medium knowledge in Python (most of the time using chatGPT and adapting the code), low knowledge SQL, regular skills with Excel and PowerBI, good knowledge of statistics. In the company, they want me to be ""lead"" without saying I am the ""lead"" data analyst (kind of...informal?), with no clear duties regarding that ""lead"" beyond organizing small projects with the other data analysts to improve the general performance of company projects, and usually dealing with programming, NLP and SNA to adapt the ideas of a manager to ""actual"" analysis into a pipeline.

**So, the question is... am I really a Data Analyst?**

How good is Capital One for a first job out of grad school?,1clled9,"Let me start out by setting some context first. I will be graduating with a Master’s degree this year from a name brand school. I have an offer to join Capital One as a Data Scientist. I went into grad school pretty much straight out of undergrad, and I don’t have any full-time experience of note going into this. 

I have some questions/thoughts, which I’d love to get some opinions on. 

1. I have been told that the role would involve modeling work and revolve around ML. Now, it’s a bank, so I’m fairly sure it’s not going to be some cutting-edge deep learning work. Most likely regressions and random forests and such, even if that? How much will this affect future opportunities going forward? Or am I just overthinking?

2. Considering it’s a bank and not exactly a tech company, am I fucked in terms of jumping to a proper tech shop a little later down the line? How favorably is C1 seen as a name on the resume in data science in particular but also within tech in general? Any insights/perspectives would be appreciated, I have absolutely no clue.

I don’t really have any other offers. A lot of fellow students I know are compromising and taking up SWE roles because they’re unable to land DS/ML roles. Others are still looking for just any offers at all. We all know the state of the job market. 

So, given all of the above, my hope is that a DS title at a fairly well-known financial services company will give me enough of a jump pad to move on to other places later. Even if this is not true, I don’t have much of an option, but I’d like some second opinions anyway. I’m too close to this to see any of it objectively.

AI startup debuts “hallucination-free” and causal AI for enterprise data analysis and decision support,1clkibc,"https://venturebeat.com/ai/exclusive-alembic-debuts-hallucination-free-ai-for-enterprise-data-analysis-and-decision-support/

Artificial intelligence startup Alembic announced today it has developed a new AI system that it claims completely eliminates the generation of false information that plagues other AI technologies, a problem known as “hallucinations.” In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Alembic co-founder and CEO Tomás Puig revealed that the company is introducing the new AI today in a keynote presentation at the Forrester B2B Summit and will present again next week at the Gartner CMO Symposium in London.

The key breakthrough, according to Puig, is the startup’s ability to use AI to identify causal relationships, not just correlations, across massive enterprise datasets over time. “We basically immunized our GenAI from ever hallucinating,” Puig told VentureBeat. “It is deterministic output. It can actually talk about cause and effect.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1clkibc/ai_startup_debuts_hallucinationfree_and_causal_ai/,Heavy-Painting-7752,219,AI,153,New

Moving to eBay as a Data Science Analyst?,1ck5fiy,"Hey all, firstly, I don't want to sound disingenuous so I really hope this doesn't come off that way.

I have a pretty non-traditional path to Data Science, I did a Bachelor of Commerce, and through a rotation program at a big Canadian bank got into a Data Science team, that was supportive and took me on despite me lacking technicals.

I've been in the position now for 2 years, mostly working with NLP and unstructured data. Doing usual Power BI dashboard, KPI antics, all the way up to using transformer embeddings for email classification models. It has been a cool role, sadly plagued with bad management, and all at a slow bank.

In recent times, the bank has gone through reorg, and we (data and analytics team)  do not have the support from senior management, nor the funding that we did maybe even a year ago. Layoffs are a small possibility, but already I feel like we have been brushed to side, with not much expectations, nor no net new projects.

Furthermore, my boss who had hired me might also be leaving, meaning I would be stuck with completely non-technical management, and I would learn nothing.

Perhaps the one good thing is the pay, but that is making it hard for me to now find a new role. My current pay is around $95K CAD + last year, a 15% bonus. With new leadership now though, that doesn't support us, I doubt we will get a bonus as fat as that anymore.

I have been interviewing with eBay for a Data Science Analyst position, working on their item buying page, and got the offer yesterday. I would report to a team in SF, but would be based in Canada. The role would be less model-building, a lot more A/B testing, from what I gathered.

**Pros of eBay:**

* Data Science at Tech company gives validity to my otherwise non-technical resume (academically, at least)
* 1 week in office and flexibility to work from abroad (according to HR); so I can travel home internationally and not burn PTO, compared to 3 in office and no flexibility currently
* Hopefully newer tech stack than the bank (fr we don't even have a SQL server set up here lmfao)
* Been with the bank for 3 years in various roles, really tired and fed up, so would be a good change and refresh
* 20K sign on for first year, 10K sign on second year, conditional to me staying for a year after receiving bonuses, in addition to equity discount purchase options, and $30K USD equity package (25%/year vest) in compensation

**Cons:**

* Only a 10% base-pay bump. Tech homies (though in SF) tell me to not settle for anything less than 20% bump between jobs.
* Not building models as much, which makes it more statistics-focused and less applied
* 80% focused on A/B testing from what I gathered
* Unsure of eBay market reputation these days, what are some companies that people end up working at after eBay?
* High rate of layoffs

In addition to all of this, I am interviewing with Intuit and Robinhood, both for more technical Data Science positions. Those would likely pay in the 120K-140K CAD range from what I understand, eBay would be at 105k.

The next step for these interviews would be the technicals, which I do not feel confident for at all (Python, SQL LeetCode Mediums + statistics and ML design questions). I haven't studied for this stuff that much, and would really be cramming.

I have told eBay that I can let them know on Monday if the compensation is okay, I am tempted to go back to them and beg for $110K CAD, which would be a 15% bump, and mention that I am interested in the role, but the pay is just not working for me, especially that I am interviewing for two other positions that may pay better. So I want to request if I can continue the interview process with the other two, and get back to eBay with a final confirmation. Not sure how to phrase this, or if I should even show my hand like that.  
eBay HR was really nice, really felt like they were gunning for me, and the offer felt like the max they could squeeze out between Payroll and the Hiring team.

I'm just confused. In light of all of this, where can/should I go?

I was 65% in favour to take, 35% to reject, but given my friends/family advice that the pay is low and not worth moving, I am unsure.

I'm also not sure how to buy myself time for the interveiws with RH and Intuit, and god if I can even do them.

Is it really that bad to move for 10% base bump? Ignoring sign-on bonus, equity, quality of life?

Lastly, I'm not sure if eBay is a boost to my career or a step down; is it a good place to work? Is it frowned upon by other companies as a ""legacy tech company"" or something?

Impact of different tool use on future job prospects,1cjzsxi,"I'm in a senior DS role right now. This is my first data job after being a professor for a few years post PhD. I'm a modeler, that's my main focus on the job, which I absolutely love. 

However, the client (I'm a consultant) uses SAS miner and guide, and does not use Python at all. Partially because they always have and partially for security concerns. As I build my models, realistically the biggest issue is making sure I do things that our (imo outdated) tech stack can handle.

I am a graduate student working on Data Science.

But they have all the machine learning related cool-looking projects on their portfolios. So their resumes might more fit to DS roles maybe, but their lack of experiences and way less number of DS jobs stop them. Then when applying DA roles, their inadequate SQL or Bi skills stop them.

I noticed this weirdness because my friend who has several cool ML projects just failed SQL interview for DA role. I know there are many data professionals here, so wanted to ask if you have notice this where there are more graduate students applicants recently but bootcamp self learners are more fit?

How to transition to machine learning engineering?,1cht1xs,"Im currently at a small tech consulting company. I have a master’s in data science but not much hard engineering experience.

 I’ve built 1 production system but it was still ‘low tech’. I was using excel files and then an AutoML tool and running time series forecasting offline at a regular cadence. But that project is done and it looks like clients I work with are all low tech and having to deploy anything with them seems like a pain. I work on POCs for ML modeling nowadays

I want to transition to a company where I can be on a better path and eventually try to be a software engineer in ML or an MLE. Finding opportunities to advance my skills are hard. I am currently interviewing at a company but the role seems more client focused and POC focused with maybe some opportunities to deploy / monitor ML systems. I am a little nervous that switching into a role that is not advertised as engineering heavy could be the wrong move

However, any company that works at large scale is probably better than what I do now. Any proper tech company where I can use proper tools like pyspark, databricks, etc seem like would put me in the path to do more engineering or ML at scale. 

I am curious what people think. What is the best way to break into MLE if you dont have large scale software experience and if your current best new role opportunities are not exactly engineering heavy but could have chances to build internal tools and deploy things sometimes? 

Personally I think I’ll try to do as much engineering work as possible in any new tech company that operates at sufficient scale. And maybe even gunning for an internal transfer to SWE / MLE if that ever shows up could be a move (and this has a chance of happening at new company not current one). And I’ll build some ML apps for personal projects as well. It seems like staying at a small consulting company will continue to hurt my long term skillsets since I don’t have exposure to proper tools and large scaled problems

Classification - using both euclidean distance and cosine similarity for inference,1chmmf3,"Context
- existing label split into 3 sub labels
- labeled historical data for existing label exists, but none for the 3 new sub labels
- idea is to use sub label description to get labeled data for the 3 sub labels
- but won't be able to get a lot of labeled data (because taggers actual role isn't to do tagging)

Given a query document, inference can be done
- option 1: using binary classifier for each sub label
- option 2: use label of the document nearest to the query document to predict label of query document
- option 3: use similarity between sub label description and query document to predict label of query document
- option 4: combination of options 2 and 3

Option 1 may not be ideal as the amount of labeled data for sub labels will likely not yield performant binary classifiers. If they don't fulfil the metrics set by stakeholders, they shouldn't be deployed which is where options 2, 3 and 4 came about. 

Option 2 is one shot classification using euclidean distance. It's opportunistic because it'll predict the sub labels if taggers had labeled the nearest document with the sub labels. 

Option 3 is zero shot classification using cosine similarity, because it doesn't rely on any historical documents to make prediction.

Option 4 mitigates the opportunistic factor of option 2 by allowing another similarity measure (option 3) to influence the prediction of the query document. This is the option I'm leaning towards should option 1 not meet stakeholders' expectations. 

Wanted to ask this is a sound approach to handling classification of documents with new labels? Or if you have tackled such problem in a different way, feel free to suggest!

What would you call a model that by nature is a feedback loop?,1cgvuy3,"So, I'm hoping someone could help me find some reading on a situation I'm dealing with. Even if that's just by providing a name for what the system is called it would be very helpful. My colleagues and I have identified a general concept at work but we're having a hard time figuring out what it's called so that we can research the implications.

tl;dr - what is this called?

1. Daily updated model with a static variable in it creates predictions of rent 
2. Predictions of rent are disseminated to managers in field to target as goal
3. When units are rented the rate is fed back into the system and used as an outcome variable
4. During this time a static predictor variable is in the model and it because it continuously contributes to the predictions, it becomes a proxy for the outcome variable

&#x200B;

I'm working on a model of rents for my employer. I've been calling the model incestuous as what happens is the model creates predictions for rents, those predictions are sent to the field where managers attempt to get said rents for a given unit. When a unit is filled the rent they captured goes back into the database where it becomes the outcome variable for the model that predicted the target rent in the first place. I'm not sure how closely the managers adhere to the predictions but my understanding is it's definitely something they take seriously.

If that situation is not sticky enough, in the model I'm updating the single family residence variables are from 2022 and have been in the model since then. The reason being, extracting it like trying to take out a bad tooth in the 1860s. When we try to replace it with more recent data it hammers goodness of fit metrics. Enough so that my boss questions why we would update it if we're only getting accuracy that's about as good as before. So I decided just to try every combination of every year of zillow data 2020 forward. Basically just throw everything at the wall and surely out of 44 combinations something will be better. That stupid 2022 variable and its cousin 21-22 growth were at the top as measured by R-Squared and AIC.

So a few days ago my colleagues and I had an idea. This variable has informed every price prediction for the past two years. Since it was introduced it has been creating our rent variable. And that's what we're predicting. The reason why it's so good at predicting is that *it is a proxy for the outcome variable*. So I split the data up by moveins in 22, 23, 24 (rent doesn't move much for in place tenants in our communities) and checked the correlation between the home values 22 variable and rent in each of those subsets. If it's a proxy for quality of neighborhoods, wealth, etc then it should be strongest in 22 and then decrease from there. Of course... it did the exact opposite.

So at this point I'm convinced this variable is, mildly put, quite wonky. I think we have to rip the bandaid off even if the model is technically worse off and instead have this thing draw from a SQL table that's updated as new data is released. Based on how much that correlation was increasing from 22 to 24, eventually this variable will become so powerful it's going to join Skynet and target us with our own weapons. But the only way to ensure buy in from my boss is to make myself a mini-expert on what's going on so I can make the strongest case possible. And unfortunately I don't even know what to call this system we believe we've identified. So I can't do my homework here. 

We've alternately been calling it self-referential, recursive, feedback loop, etc. but none of those are yielding information.

I work as a ML engineer looking to leave my current employer soon. I realized in the past year or so, that I actually dislike the modeling/stats part of it all and enjoy engineering. I have degrees in math and stats, and gotten good grades, so it's not like I am bad at it. And I actually liked these in school. But in my career, I am not really enjoying that aspect anymore, and want to just focus on engineering and building stuff. I no longer care about reading up on statistical models and ML papers. I get that Attention is all I need, but I no longer care to pay attention to Attention, if you get my drift.

So I am looking to leave data science and ML and pivot towards an adjacent engineering role, something like data engineering, MLOps, analytics engineering, platform engineering and the like. At the same time, I feel like AI/ML is the future and will explode in demand very soon, if it isn't already there. Perhaps it's fomo or feeling that my education in math/stats have gone to waste, but there is a part of me that feels like I am downgrading or moving down the career ladder by doing this. I also see most people trying to move \*towards\* ML so I feel like I am doing something wrong by making such a move.

I am wondering if anybody has faced something similar before and pivoted completely towards engineering rather than the ML model development and stats side (e.g. the ""sexy"" parts of data science). If you did, I would like to hear your story. What made you transition to an engineering focus? And do you regret it? Do you think you will eventually go back to ML/AI side or stay in engineering?

How should I bounce back after an almost 5 year hiatus?,1cfwl2u,"Given the recent explosion of LLMs, GenAI, and the likes, how do I go about charting my career trajectory? 

I have been on maternity leave since late last year and was laid off before the leave started. Before that, I was at a small startup since the beginning of the pandemic and my work mainly resembled academic projects like demonstrating predictive modelling on publicly available datasets, generating insights and developing pipelines for small (~200k rows) databases. Fwiw, I was at a big saas company for 2 years before as a data scientist with 1 yoe in engineering and 1 yoe in analytics. 

My interests and skills are mainly in engineering and development. I like generating insights from data but R&D aspect of experimenting and presenting results is where I find having the most fun.

Communication is where I need to improve on. I feel that I need to diversify my skill set since getting jobs in R&D is super competitive. 

I understand that I will have to ""start over"" and learn many things from scratch. I am just so discouraged with the job hunt seeing the current market that I decided to make a Github repo and build up my portfolio alongside child-care duties.

But, what do I do? What courses or what sort of projects do I undertake? It's all so overwhelming, I feel my experience worthless leaving me completely blank.

[NLP] Detect news headlines at the intersection of Culture & Technology,1cfvts1,"Hi nerds!

I’m a web dev with 10YoE and for the first time I’m working on a NLP project from scratch so… I’m in need of some wisdom.

Here's my goal : **detect news headlines at the intersection of Culture and Technology**.   

For example:
- VR usage in museums
- AI art (in music, movies, litterature etc)
- digital creativity
- cultural heritage & tech
- VC funding in the creativity space
- … you get the idea.

I've built Django app, scraping a ton of data from hundreds of RSS feeds in this space, but it’s not labeled or anything and there’s a lot of irrelevant noise. The intersection of Culture and Technology is rare, and also blurry because the concept of ""Culture"" is hard to catch.

I figured I need to create a ML classifier for news headlines, so as a first step I have manually labeled ~300 news headlines as revelant - to use as training data.

Now I'm experimenting with scikit-learn to build the classifier but I have really no idea what I'm doing.

My questions are:
1. Do you think my approach makes sense (manually labeling + training a ML classifier on top)
2. Do you have any recommendation regarding the type of classifier and the tools to build it ?
3. Do you know any dataset that could help me      
4. Do you have any advice in general for a rookie like me

Roast my Startup Idea - Tableau Version Control,1cftuh0,"Ok, so I currently work as a Tableau Developer/Data Analyst and I thought of a really cool business idea, born out of issues that I've encountered working on a Tableau team.

For those that don't know, Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence tool. PowerBI is its main competitor.

So, there is currently no version control capabilities in Tableau. The closest thing they have is *version history,* which just lets you revert a dashboard to a previously uploaded one. This is only useful if something breaks and you want to ditch all of your new changes.

.twb and .twbx (Tableau workbook files) are actually XML files under the hood. This means that you technically can throw them into GitHub to do version control with, there are certain aspects of ""merging"" features/things on a dashboard that would break the file. Also, there is no visual aspect to these merges, so you can't see what the dashboard would look like after you merge them.

Collaboration is another aspect that is severely lacking. If 2 people wanted to work on the same workbook, one would literally have to email their version to the other person, and the other person would have to manually rectify the changes between the 2 files. In terms of version control, Tableau is in the dark ages.

I'm not entirely sure how technically possible it would be to create a version control software based on the underlying XML, but based on what I've seen so far from the XML structure, it seems possible

Disclaimer, I am not currently working on this idea, I just thought of it and want to know what you think.

The business model would be B2B and it would be a SaaS business. Tableau teams would acquire/use this software the same way they use any other enterprise programming tool.

For the companies and teams that do use Tableau Server already, I think this would be a pretty reasonable and logical next purchase for their org. The target market for sales would be directors and managers who have the influence and ability to purchase software for their teams. The target users of the software would be tableau developers, data analysts, business intelligence developer, or really anyone who does any sort of reporting or visualization in Tableau.

So, what do you think of this business idea?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cftuh0/roast_my_startup_idea_tableau_version_control/,NFeruch,0,Tools,6,New

Seeking feedback on project scoping,1cfnvnx,"Can I get your feedback on some scoping work?

My task is to assess the accuracy of a system that calculates payments for invoices. It's an open-ended request for rough-and-ready insights. I am thinking through the analytical approach while waiting for data.

The complex payment policies make it impractical to independently validate individual payments at scale, so I can't directly label the payments as correct or incorrect. Instead I plan to characterize payment distributions and work with SMEs to distinguish those that fall in plausible and implausible ranges. I imagine a linear regression that controls for known payment drivers (e.g., type and quantity of services), enabling me to interpret large residuals as anomalous payments.

After this initial pass, I would work with SMEs to hypothesize causes for implausible payments and extract features to capture those causes (e.g., a flag for invoices that later had to be corrected). Then I would try to use these features to cluster implausible cases or separate them from plausible ones. The goal would be an interpretable model that highlights common scenarios causing payment anomalies.

"Feel like MS program puts me in a box, is the real job more creative?",1cfdry5,"I have been somewhat feeling “boxed in” terms of creativity lately in my masters program. I just feel like coursework is solving the most trivial useless things by hand and then not actually doing anything hands on. I’m in a masters stats position program and even though I’m doing well in the coursework, I rarely get to actually “DO” any of the things I’m learning. 

Like for example in my statistical inference theory class we spend like a week covering how to find rejection regions for hypothesis tests by hand using likelihood ratio tests, and then just do these derivations constantly. Same in my bayes class.

For example, the course I enjoy the most so far is my data visualization class because we are actually building a dashboard, and it made me realize how much I need to sharpen up my data cleaning skills. Being in theory classes for years in undergrad and now in grad school It was a huge wake up call to practice the basics outside of class.

Lately, I have been reading the research posted by tech companies, where they talk about what data scientists are doing out there in the real world, and the statistical methods that are being created and leveraged, and they are actually putting what they learn into practice and get so much creativity and freedom.

I’m frankly just looking forward to graduate and work because I’m so tired of not actually doing the real stuff and solving real problems. I’m hoping there’s more creativity fostered as oppose to a classroom. Does anyone feel this way about masters programs sometimes? You come away with a deeper knowledge at a theoretical level but you don’t actually solve any real problems so you can feel your in a box, and itch to do some real stuff.

In my experience, my company does a lot of work on LLMs and I can say with absolute certainty that those projects are permutations and combinations of making an intelligent chatbot which can chat with your proprietary documents, summarize information, build dashboards and so on. I've prototyped these RAG systems (nothing in production, thankfully) and am not enjoying building them. I also don't like the LLM framework wars (Langchain vs Llamaindex vs this and that - although, Langchain sucks in my opinion).

What are the pressing research questions? What are the topics that I can explore in my personal (or company) time beyond RAG systems?

Finally, can anyone explain what the heck is agentic AI? Is it just a fancy buzzword for this sentence from Russell and Norvig's magnum opus AI book- "" A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome"".

Should I take the new offer?,1cequga,"I need help deciding if I should take a new job offer. I’m a recent grad and have 6 months of experience in my current role as a systems analyst at an academic research hospital. I mainly write SQL procedures, conduct ad-hoc data requests/data changes, do some light reporting, and write internal documentation. My salary is in the low 70s and I work fully remotely (don’t live with parents). I really love the team I work with, the work is fairly easy and stress-free, and the work-life balance is amazing.

I recently received an offer at a large health insurance company as a data analyst in a new grad rotational program. This offer is hybrid (2 days remote 3 days in-office) and pays in the high 70s + a variable yearly bonus. The office is 1 mile from where I live and I could walk or take 1 bus ride. There's a promotion and chance of full remote work depending on the team I join when the 1-year rotational program ends. This role aligns more with my career goals of becoming a data scientist and seems like I’d have more opportunities for career growth in the long run.

I’m having a hard time deciding whether to take this new role. The team I work with feels like a family and I don’t want to make the mistake of thinking the grass is greener on the other side when it feels like I have it pretty good in my first role out of college. The work in my current role also feels a bit more “meaningful” compared to big health insurance. However, I don’t really feel challenged right now.

On the other hand, I think the new role would open more doors for me in the future with a name brand on my resume, more analytics skills, and working with a more diverse tech stack. I’ll also be able to network and learn from more data scientists and analysts. I don’t do any analytics in my current role, but my manager supports my career goals.

LLMs: Why does in-context learning work? What exactly is happening from a technical perspective?,1cdii27,"Everywhere I look for the answer to this question, the responses do little more than anthropomorphize the model. They invariably make claims like:

> *Without examples, the model must infer context and rely on its knowledge to deduce what is expected. This could lead to misunderstandings.*

> *One-shot prompting reduces this cognitive load by offering a specific example, helping to anchor the model's interpretation and focus on a narrower task with clearer expectations.*

> *The example serves as a reference or hint for the model, helping it understand the type of response you are seeking and triggering memories of similar instances during training.*

> *Providing an example allows the model to identify a pattern or structure to replicate. It establishes a cue for the model to align with, reducing the guesswork inherent in zero-shot scenarios.*

These are real excerpts, btw.

But these models don’t “understand” anything. They don’t “deduce”, or “interpret”, or “focus”, or “remember training”, or “make guesses”, or have literal “cognitive load”. They are just statistical token generators. Therefore pop-sci explanations like these are kind of meaningless when seeking a concrete understanding of the exact mechanism by which in-context learning improves accuracy.

Can someone offer an explanation that explains things in terms of the actual model architecture/mechanisms and how the provision of additional context leads to better output? I can “talk the talk”, so spare no technical detail please.

I could make an educated guess - Including examples in the input which use tokens that approximate the kind of output you want leads the attention mechanism and final dense layer to weight more highly tokens which are similar in some way to these examples, increasing the odds that these desired tokens will be sampled at the end of each forward pass; like fundamentally I’d guess it’s a similarity/distance thing, where explicitly exemplifying the output I want increases the odds that the output get will be similar to it - but I’d prefer to hear it from someone else with deep knowledge of these models and mechanisms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cdii27/llms_why_does_incontext_learning_work_what/,synthphreak,55,ML,39,New

To look or not to look for a new job,1cc3pqe,"

I have been recently contemplating whether to look for a new job or not. I read somewhere to make a pros and cons list to figure out if I should. Here is my list, looking for some constructive feedback.

Pros:

* Job Security in an uncertain economy.
* Recently got promoted to senior DS, direct manager responsible for pushing for promotion.
* Work from home and pretty flexible working hours.
* Moved to a low cost city, but current salary based on high COL city.
* Some really good technical teammates to learn new technologies from, unfortunately they do not want to be managers, but prefer to be senior level ICs.
* Generally treated as a high performer.
* Slim chance of promotion if team members leave.
* Kids wouldn't have to move again, good school district.

Cons:

* Company financials not looking good, cash infusion from board, C-level suite revamped.
* No more merit based increases in the foreseeable future, freezing hire. No more promotions or career growth until company stabilizes.
* Direct Manager (female) was effectively stripped of role in departmental restructuring.
* Skip Manager (male) was initially not supportive of promotion and now is direct manager.
* Career growth looks non-existent, especially as a female, skip manager effectively made all white male middle managers during reorg.
* Working at fintech, there is not much innovation in terms of modeling, stuck with binary classification (default prediction) most of the time.
* Good at and interested in improving MLOps /MLE work (deploying models and improving infrastructure), but skip manager effectively delegated the women in the team to model delivery and put all the men in technical work. Also doesn’t recognize technical skillset.
* Looking for a new job would mean lower salaries based on general trend and recently moving to a low COL city.
* General dread of being typecast in fintech space with not a lot of exposure to other modeling techniques.

"Hired as a “Sr. Data Science Analyst”, but not doing any DS",1cc2jun,"Started in December as a Sr. Data Science Analyst, but all the work I’ve been doing so far revolves around jumping around between several internal systems to try to explain any KPI changes of >2% to our leaders. So let’s say arbitrary KPI A is 100 on Monday, but then it’s 95 on Tuesday and then 94 on Wednesday, my job is to figured out what the root cause of the change is and to have answers “quickly”. We run an online sales portal with a multitude of variables that can lead to changes in our KPIs. A lot of the functioning of these variables are not well documented. The sources I’m expected to go to in order to find my explanations are a mix of already-created Tableau and PBI dashboards, some more bespoke internal systems (same dynamic as a dashboard basically), maybe some SQL querying against Redshift, and my own intuition. That’s it. No modeling, no experimentation, no Python unless I make an explicit decision to spend time writing something, and no longterm projects besides maybe building more dashboards to help explain things even faster. I’m pretty slow now as this sort of work relies heavily on familiarity with what dashboard/report to go to for what and how everything ties together but just feels like I might be in the wrong spot.

Am I tripping? The whole reason I took this role was because it’s “Data Science” focused, but I’ve seen very little to no actual data science at all.

What (online) courses/program should I take to become a ML engineer?,1cc03aj,"I am a statistics & machine learning researcher. I have invented some new methods, built packages in C++, R, and Python. I am also a machine learning consultant (part-time), but I usually tell people what to do and give feedback rather than do things myself. I don't like this experience though. 

So you can see, I probably know lots about theory, methodology & practical applications. However, I always want to switch to a more ""technical"" position after getting a PhD, i.e. machine learning engineer or SWE with focus on ML. I do feel like not having a formal training in SWE and CS would make me unemployable in the MLE field, so I always want to take some online SWE courses/programs to fill in the gap.

My goal is to know about the engineering process behind SWE and to take relevant technical SWE/CS courses that most SWE/CS students do. You know, I can code, but it doesn't mean I will be a good MLE 🤣

Do you have any suggestions? Like a SWE track on a MOOC platform. I do know they are not perfect, but I do practice a lot, and can work on personal projects. Hopefully, they will be useful :)

Suggest on food ingredients dataset,1cbsama,"Hi, I'm a student and I need some advice about data for food recommendation system project.

In my perspective, that kind of data design is kinda complex but really easy to process, efficient for data analyst. But my teammate say it weird, idk what is his reason, I asked him but he just said he has never seen this kind of design so he proposed us to find a dataset that contain the ingredients in a single column.

"Difference between MLE , Data Scientist and Data Engineer ",1cbpt74,"I am new to industry and I don't seem to find a proper answer to this question.  

I know Data Scienctist is expected to model.  Train models do Post Production Monitoring. Fine-tuning and maybe retraining. Apparently retraining involves a lot of beaurcratic hoops. Maybe some production . 

Data engineers would do preprocessing, ETL , building Warehouse ,SQL queries, CI/CD. Pipeline and scraping.  To some extent data scientists do it.  Dont feel comfortable personally but doable. Not the best coder but good enough to write psuedocode and gpt ky way out 

Analysts will do insights and EDA. 


THAT PRETTY MUCH COMPLETES A CYCLE. 
What exactly does an MLE do then . There are many overlaps but what exactly will an MLE do.  I think it would entail MLOps and also Data engineering?  So like everything

Discussion: AI for data science,1casob4,"**Do you think that AI can help data science teams beyond just ""ask data / text2sql"" chatbots?**

I've been in DS for a while, both as an IC and now as a lead. Despite improvements in analytics tools and workflows, getting to meaningful insights is still a very labor intensive and code heavy process. It especially takes a significant time to perform exploratory/foundational analysis, which can limit the ability to tackle more specialized problems and also increases the risk of overlooking something entirely.

I've been building something to address this, here's the elevator pitch: **an autonomous AI data scientist that proactively explores data, discovers insights, and presents findings in plain English**. This will give data teams an advantage by discovering core insights faster and pinpointing precisely where to initiate more in-depth analysis.

I have an MVP that can do what I am promising - users can connect/upload data and the product will iteratively plan, perform analysis, and interpret the results, each time summarizing findings into key themes. Under the hood, I'm using LLMs to orchestrate analysis and interpret results but using robust data science pipelines to perform the actual analysis. Accuracy and reliability is at the core.

I'm curious about the community's thoughts on this problem and my approach for a solution. Am I onto something or do I have it wrong?

* How much time do you/your teams spend on foundational analysis compared to deeper problem-solving or modeling?
* Is time often a limiting factor to how much you can explore before committing to a certain analysis path?
* Assuming you could trust its output, do you think ""proactive"" AI driven insights would be valuable?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1casob4/discussion_ai_for_data_science/,SwimmingMeringue9415,5,Discussion,25,New

Less Weighting to assign to outliers in  time series forecasting?,1c99xba,"Hi data scientists here, 

I've tried to ask my colleagues at work but seems I didn't find the right group of people. We use time series forecasting , specifically Facebook Prophet , to forecast revenue. The revenue is similar to data packages with a telecom provided to customers. With certain subscriptions we have seen huge spike because of hacked accounts hence outliers, and they are 99% one time phenomenon. Another kind of outliers come from users who ramp their usage occasionally 

Does FB Prophet have a mechanism to assign very little weight to outliers? I thought there's some theory in probablities which says the probability of a certain random variable  being further away from a specific number converges to zero. (Weak law of large number) . So can't we assign a very little weight to those dots that are very far from the mean (i.e. large variance) or below a certain probability ?

Am I a coding Imposter?,1c8ru38,"Hello DS fellows,

I've been working in the Data Science space for 7+ years now (was in a different career before that).  However, I continue to feel very inadequate to the point that I constantly have this imposter syndrome about my coding skills that I want to ask for your opinions/feedback.

Despite my 7+ years of writing codes and scripting in Python, I still have to look up the syntax 70% - 80% of the times on the internet when I do my projects.  The problem is that I have hard time remembering the syntax.  Because of this, most of the times I just copy and paste code chunks from my previous works and then modify them;  yet even when doing modification I still have to look up the syntax on the internet if something new is needed to add.

I have coded in C and C++ in the past and I suffered the same problem but it was for short periods of time so I didn't think anything about it back then.

Besides this, I don't have any issues with solving complicated problems because I tend to understand the math/stats very well and derive solution plans for them.  But when it comes to coding it up, I find myself looking up the syntax too often even when I have been using Python for 7+ years now (average about 1-2 coding times per week).

I feel very embarrassed about this particular short-coming and want to ask 2 questions:

1. Is this normal for those with similar length of experience?
2. If this is not normal, how can I improve?

Appreciate the responses and feedbacks!

=========  
**Update:**  Thanks everyone for your responses.  This now seems like a common problem for most.  To clarify, I don't need to look up simple syntax when coding in Python.

"Sampling from a large, not independent dataset  ",1c8jbrm,"So I’m building a simple regression model to predict fuel consumption for trucks in a large food company. We have data from different trips  from different routes.

Now that isn’t something we want because we would like to take into account different geographic information from the various routes (a route has a number of geographic and specific features). Should I just perform stratified sampling? 

This brings me to our second problem, that the different trips won’t be independent.

Imputation methods satisfying constraints,1c7xt1z,"Hey everyone,

I have here a dataset of KPI metrics from various social media posts. For those of you lucky enough to not be working in digital marketing, the metrics in question are things like:

* ""impressions"" (number of times a post has been seen)
* ""reach"" (number of unique accounts who have seen a post) 
* ""clicks"", ""comments"", ""likes"", ""shares"", etc (self-explanatory)

The dataset in question is incomplete, the missing values are distributed across pretty much every dimension, and my job is to develop a model to fill in those missing values. So far I've tested a KNN imputer with some success, as well as an Iterative imputer (MICE) with much better results. 

But there's 1 problem that persists: some values need to be constrained by others in the same entry. Imagine for instance that a given post had 55 ""Impressions"", meaning that it has been seen 55 times, and we try to fill the missing ""Reach"" (number of unique accounts that have seen that post). Obviously that amount cannot be higher than 55. A post cannot be viewed 55 times by 60 different accounts. There are a bunch of such constraints that I somehow need to pass in to my model, I've tried looking into the MICE algorithm to find an answer there but without success. 

Does anyone know of a way I can enforce these types of constraints? Or is there another data imputation method that's better suited for this type of task?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c7xt1z/imputation_methods_satisfying_constraints/,Antoinefdu,3,Analysis,5,New
How much does the topic of a MS Stat thesis matter when hiring? ,1c7mn25,"I’m going to be starting my Masters Thesis in my stats program. I have narrowed down two projects with different faculty members. One of them is entirely self guided, and that advisor doesn’t really have any expertise in this area and the other one is basically with another faculty member but the research topic is within his domain, so he can help me, but the application strays too far from what industry I want to be in.

Project 1:  Causal Machine Learning, and nonparametric estimation for identifying heterogenous treatment effects in advertising/marketing data. 

There’s a dataset by a company in the marketing/adtech space that they have made public, and is essentially an open dataset related to shopping transactions, and demographics of shoppers, and information on marketing campaigns that were run by the company. 

Ideally this would be a causal inference project, where I get to actually learn causal inference and causal (double) machine learning on my own, and apply it to this dataset. No new methods being created, just a standalone causal inference analysis and basically I walk away with learning a new area of statistics and a way to solve causal problems. 

My advisors background is nonparametric regression so he would be able to give me advice on the estimators being used (some of the methods use random forests, tree based methods, splines, kernel methods etc.) so he could be of help in that sense. But he knows nothing about causal inference. So I’d be on my own on this one.

I want to take on this project despite it being quite isolated because I want to signal to my future employer that I can work on data science problems involving causal inference.
 
I only have 1 year, so id have to self learn causal inference + do the analysis + the paper. 

Project 2: Bayesian Dimension Reduction in gene expression data

Another advisor works in the area of dimension reduction, and broadly works in genomics. The project he was proposing for me was an actual opportunity to create some new methods. So much more on the research side than doing an analysis like project 1. 

It involves looking at Bayesian approaches to doing common dimension reduction techniques like PCA, Factor Analysis etc.

From this paper I’d walk away with a good opporuntity to  dive deeper into Bayesian inference, and work on methods research. I’ve never done a bayes project before, despite just taking a class on it.

The cons to this is I don’t really have any interest working in bioinformatics, but this research is within the realm of my advisor so he can actually help me. The other con, is I don’t want my future employer to think I’m not qualified for tasks involving causal inference because I worked on dimension reduction, and with applications to genetic data, which is not really the industry I want to be in. 


Does anyone have any input on this? Does choosing a topic not related to causal inference lessen my chances of getting a job involving that? Do people care what my thesis topic is?

Developments outside the world of LLMs and GenAI,1c7k28c," Hi everyone, 

I want to know if there are developments and research topics that are outside/completely orthogonal to LLMs and generative AI. To be honest, I am **bored** of LLMs. I don't care about the performance of Model X vs Models A,B,C,D etc. Moreover, at least 8 out of 10 projects in my organization are focused on generative AI and RAG. While I understand the usefulness of these ideas, I think there's an overload of information that is not particularly helpful for my brain.

Personally, I am interested in scientific machine learning- drug discovery, climate change, physics simulations. If there are other research areas that you are aware of, please feel free to share.

Is pursuing DS instead of SWE a bad idea?,1c7cytp,"I've a CS degree and I'm currently working as a new grad Data Analyst. Aside from building dashboards and reports, I also do a lot of data engineering and some ML modelling. I'm planning to get a CS Masters after 1 - 2 years of work, then switch to DS. But looking at this sub, it seems like a lot of people recommend switching to SWE instead? I do enjoy software engineering work so I wouldn't mind the transition, but I'm interested in ML and thought DS would be a good career path for that.

Is Data Science really a dying field and pay less than SWE? I even heard that switching from DS to SWE is more difficult than the other way around, because any SWE learning ML can do DS work. And I've seen people saying that SWE is more stable and easier to get a job than DS.

Data Science is fun!,1c7bw30,"Hi everyone, I’m a marketing major about to graduate in May. A year and a half ago I took basic hypothesis testing/linear modeling class to try out an analytics certificate at my school, and I fell in love with statistics for the first time. When I began looking for job/internship opportunities around that time I was worried because while I didn’t mind marketing, I also didn’t love it. That’s when I made the decision to continue my degree in business, and work every week towards becoming a data analyst (and eventually, a data scientist! But I’m patient, and I wanted to wait until I’m ready. There’s a lot to statistics/programming, as I now know… lol). 

It’s been a long and *very* hard road. But I now have a job as a data analyst and I’m working on a large machine learning personal project now. I see a lot of negative discussion in this sub (which is entirely fair); however, I just wanted you all to know that as someone who is not taking the traditional route into data science, I think your job is awesome. I think what you do is fascinating and what statistical modeling might accomplish in the future is inspiring. Have a great day, and I hope I have the pleasure of meeting some of you in the field one day.

Data Scientist: job preparation guide 2024,1c7aqn0,"I have been hunting jobs for almost 4 months now. It was after 2 years, that I opened my eyes to the outside world and in the beginning, the world fell apart because I wasn't aware of how much the industry has changed and genAI and LLMs were now mandatory things. Before, I was just limited to using chatGPT as UI. 

So, after preparing for so many months it felt as if I was walking in circles and running across here and there without an in-depth understanding of things. I went through around 40+ job posts and studied their requirements, (for a medium seniority DS position).

How big of a jump is it from Data Scientist to ML Engineer?,1c79bse,"I'm considering applying for a Machine Learning Engineer position with my company. I already work as a Data Scientist. I've developed a great reputation and most of the executives know who I am and frequently ask for my input on things. I'm happy with my job, but unfortunately, it feels a bit dead-end'ish. It's a great job, don't get me wrong, but I don't see any obvious path to promotion, short of waiting it out 10 years and that frustrates me a lot. 

There are more long-term opportunities in ML Engineering in my company. Salary should be a bit higher as well; I'm estimating I'd make at least $25k more. 

As a DS, I mostly work with Python, SQL, and Tableau. I'd say only about 20% of my time is spent coding, however. I've built a few machine learning models (mostly time-series and collaborative filtering), but it's not the main crux of what I do. Still, I'm pretty universally regarded as the expert on ML as well as tech on the team. Moreover, I've automated a lot of our analysis. I'd be considered an expert on SQL and data analysis, as well. 

If I switch to MLE, I'd also need to become proficient in Databricks, Azure, and React. I don't work with any of those on a regular basis (I've used Azure and Databricks before, but not a lot). I'm guessing I'd probably go from coding maybe 20% of the time to coding 70%+ of the time, as well. React is probably the toughest one there, but I do have front-end experience from working as a full-stack developer at a start-up a few years back; albeit, I'd consider myself very far from an expert on front-end. 

I'd be very good at it, but I admit it might take me 1-2 months to ""get into a groove"" and get comfortable with some of the technologies I'm less familiar with, particularly React. I learn quickly, but I often feel like people want take a chance on anyone who doesn't already know every skill in the job requirement. 

My questions:

**How big of a jump is this?** I don't use Databricks on a regular basis, but given my proficiency in Python and SQL, is that going to be something that would take a long time to get familiar with? Is my relative inexperience in React a big issue or is it just so difficult to find an ML Engineer with React experience to begin with, that I might get a pass on that? 

**Is it worthwhile?** Anyone who has worked on both the business-facing DS side and the more tech-oriented ML side, did you enjoy one more than the other? 

**Am I likely to get serious consideration?** I have a very good reputation within the company, but often feels like some of the more pure tech people look down on someone more business-facing like myself. I'm not sure how I'll be perceived, since my background was business before I got into tech.

Career advice regarding role transition.,1c75tlv,"I am currently a data scientist in a big bank. Overall my experience in my team was hell.

Some of my experiences were
1) bad stakeholders that bad mouth the analytics team. Stakeholders are very pushy and thus 5-6 month projects are compressed into 2 months. Effective we have a stakeholder from hell, and has a reputation for lynching managers. One of the managers i was on good terms I worked with effectively got lynched for things outside of their control. 

2)  i had an old manager that bad mouthed me as we didnt work well together then left. Manager was very toxic however any achievement is an uphill battle.

3) i ended up having to work a lot of hours, however i tried to draw boundaries to my team and ended up getting reprimand and my manager was essentially making my life a living hell and then put me on a pip.

4) I got crap for taking a sick leave due to a surgery despite telling them 3-4 months in advance.

5)our turnover is bad, we lose 1 data scientist a year if not more. 

6) my new manager effectively helps my coworkers but tells me to figure it our and does not i include me in meetings that are critical for my project. After withholding that information, in my touchbases with the manager she then criticizes my work for information that she witheld. 

However lately, they really fixed their attitude as i had to work extra hours to meet their deadlines while still looking for jobs. As of now they started adding more projects and tasks for me while I am in a pip. 

My pip was 6 weeks, and the manager slipped up saying the 8 week process. 6 weeks pip-2 weeks to be fired.

My personal guess is that they realized that I am not as bad as I am essentially the model janitor who fixes other people mistakes and when anything goes wrong I get blamed for it. A model is performing poorly, go rebuild it. This model has no documentation go rebuild it. This senior manager built an outrageously bad dataset go build it. 

Also i know critical dataset info and my own new manager does not know a lot of stuff on our data sources. While doing my job i was doing my managers job as she had no clue how to get any data or the problems with it.

Now that I have another offer with slightly more pay, but working in a startup i am strongly rethinking of just giving them the FU and leaving myself. However startups are risky and its not as prestigious as the bank. The benefits/PTO are worse (despite not being able to cash out or use pto in my current job for a year 7.5 weeks of pto unused), also given the bonuses and etc. its actually worse as the startup offers a static bonus of 7500 with 95000 base with my current role is 90,900 with 10% bonus, however i can feel they will still overwork me but i am considered to be very technical and start fresh.
The role offers more finance opportunities specific to risk modeling rather than pricing which i dont know if it will have major applications in other industries.

My friend and family are saying that its not worth it. While my current job effectively makes me get panic attacks, insomnia for months (i wake up in the middle of the night from the stress), and also i stayed for weeks not eating from stress.

The job is hell, and now the tone on is slightly better but i really dont trust my team as I think

Sorry if this is sound unhinged, but i finally got a ticket out and I wanted professional advice on how I would approach this situation.

Job hunt update.,1c6p6m4,"I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/s/5MjMTDtBYB) after getting an offer a couple months ago. A couple weeks after the offer, it was rescinded. Probably for the best as I realized the original description did not match the actual role.

After the offer was rescinded, I took a couple weeks off the job hunt before getting back at it. Cleaned up the resume, started being more selective with where I applied, and grinding SQL problems online. About a month in I was interviewing with 3 companies. 

I don't feel like making another Sankey, but it's pretty much identical to the last, except I got 3 first round interviews, rather than the 1 last time. Companies are 1 mid-sized tech and 2 pre-IPO unicorns. I was ghosted by one unicorn after a screening round and am still interviewing with the other after 2 rounds, though after 5 rounds with the mid-sized tech I accepted a DS manager position.

My advice: 1) stop following this subreddit, it's 90% doom posting and 10% circle jerk. It doesn't feel like anyone here is actually interested in data science beyond getting a job. 2) mass send an easy to parse resume everywhere. 3) keep your head up, it's a grind. Don't forget to exercise, eat well, and have a social outlet. 4) referrals aren't worth what they once were. None of my dozen or so referrals resulted in even a screening interview 

I was rejected for roles I thought I was a shoo-in for and interviewed for roles I thought were a reach. There's a lot of luck (preparation+opportunity) involved that's often out of your control.

Good luck

Preparation for a Final Round Interview for a Data Science Internship,1c6oilu,"Hello Everyone!

This Friday, I have an upcoming final-round interview with the Director of the division I'd be interning under if I got the position.

Per the recruiter, this is just to sort of solidify me as the right candidate for this role. I know that there won't be any sort of technical/coding aspect as it is just a 30-minute call.

If anyone has any advice on how to approach it, it would be greatly appreciated! This is my first ever final round interview so any advice would be great!

Thanks and have a great day!

EDIT:

I had the interview and I'll find out early next week the decision in regards to the internship. All I can say is that the final round is mainly about you and how you are/how you think as a person. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/articles/final-interview-questions) provides a really good list of questions you might be asked. In my case, I was asked about what I'd like to get out of the internship, how would I describe myself, if I've ever had a disagreement with someone on a project what was my course of action, and why do you specifically want to work for us. A bunch of behavioral stuff. 

I will say that the advice provided by u/Dangerous_Media_2218 and u/data_story_teller is super helpful in terms of what to ask in terms of the job.

"What are some good approaches to detect mislabeling/misclassification while being resilient to outliers, anomalies, and new emergent classes?",1c6c2da,"I'm working on a self-driven project where I'm taking data, clustering it using DBSCAN or OPTICS, and passing the data and labels to a classifier to train. The overall goal is anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and behavioral analysis and my approach has been to remove conserved (repeated) patterns as ""knowns"", provide a best-fit for anomalies under the assumption that the sample belongs to a known class but contains a type of anomaly (or is an outlier), and to flag unknown cases as either more prominent anomalies or, in cases where anomalies bear a measure of self-similarity, a new, emergent class.

Currently, I am using an ensemble of OVR binary classifiers (SVMs), each trained on a single target class against all other samples, as a recognition network. I also have a boosted ensemble (random forest) trained similarly to provide consensus to the output of the recognition system.

I have a k-NN classifier that is trained only on clustered data (samples labeled as noise by clustering was removed from this training set) to act as a rectification system for mislabeling/misclassification.

So, if a sample is passed through and there's a consensus in the recognition network, it can bypass the rectification system. If consensus is not met, the rectification system attempts to identify the class. If the probability is high enough, it's flagged as an anomaly of class N and sent out for further anomaly detection and isolation. If the rectification system's probability output is too low (or more than 1 label has a similar probability), it's flagged for analyst review.

Does this make sense? It works well in most cases but I don't quite have the warm and fuzzy on the misclassification detection. It seems kind of nebulous when it comes to recognizing a known class, an anomalous sample of a known class, a new class, or a variant/evolution/subclass of a known class. That's where I'm wanting to go with this.

Using Cloud Compute and Parallelization,1c5jwqv," 

I’m running transformer models from Hugging Face on my laptop with python/jupyter notebooks. These notebooks take hours to run and I’d like to learn how to accelerate them. I believe my next steps are working with a cloud computing service to offload my code onto stronger computers, as well as editing my code to make use of parallelization.

Does anyone have recommendations on services and/or resources for how to get started? I’m probably going to start looking into some sort of aws service (sagemaker?) and my friend mentioned dask to me, so I’ll look into that as well.

Right now my code is calling these models using the standard pipeline method within a list comprehension. I believe I’ll need to change that, as I’m expecting that to not be parallelizable. Any advice? I’ve got a data frame with many rows and I’m trying to run a model on text within these rows for things like sentiment analysis and zero shot classification.

"Real-time hypothesis testing, premature stopping ",1c4uvfr,"Say I want to start offering a discount for shopping in my store. I want to run a test to see if it's a cost-effective idea. I demand an improvement of $d in average sale $s to compensate for the cost of the discount. I start offering the discount randomly to every second customer. Given the average traffic in my store, I determine I should be running the experiment for at least 4 months to determine the true effect equal to d at alpha 0.05 with 0.8 power. 


1. Should my hypothesis be: 

H0: s_exp - s_ctrl < d

And then if I reject it means there's evidence the discount is cost effective (and so I start offering the discount to everyone) 

Or 

H0: s_exp - s_ctrl > d 

And then if I don't reject it means there's *no* evidence the discount is *not* cost effective (and so i keep offering the discount to everyone or at least to half of the clients to keep the test going)


2. What should I do if after four months, my test is not conclusive? All in all, I don't want to miss the opportunity to increase the profit margin, even if true effect is 1.01*d, right above the cost-effectiveness threshold. As opposed to pharmacology, there's no point in being too conservative in making business right? Can I keep running the test and avoid p-hacking?


3. I keep monitoring the average sales daily, to make sure the test is running well. When can I stop the experiment before preassumed amount of sample is collected, because the experimental group is performing very well or very bad and it seems I surely have enough evidence to decide now? How to avoid p-hacking with such early stopping?


Bonus 1: say I know a lot about my clients: salary, height, personality. How to keep refining what discount to offer based on individual characteristics? Maybe men taller than 2 meters should optimally receive two times higher discount for some unknown reasons?


Bonus 2: would bayesian hypothesis testing be better-suited in this setting? Why?

FNN to predict improper vouchers. ,1c35bvi,"I am an auditor for a state agency, we audit payments the state makes every day to find improper voucher. 

We get about 30,000 vouchers a day so obviously we can’t audit all of them. So we set up certain risks associated with vouchers to try and better find improper payments. And sometime we have filters for payments that meet certain criteria that must get audited. 

However, our risk based design doesn’t really work, it’s just a chance of whether or not the vouchers selected for audited are improper or not. I don’t believe we have any better outcome that just randomly selecting a voucher everyday. 

It just depends on the risks the auditors look for and how well they look at it. However, I am trying to create a statistical model to find these improper vouchers based on these risks. 

As opposed to what some auditor thinks is the best risk, the model can look at all these risks and see how they interact and if there is some pattern. 

Additionally, a lot of these risks have some arbitrary cut off date. For example, we might have a risk saying the specific vendor hasn’t been audited in over a year. That’s considered risky, however, a voucher that misses that by one year wouldn’t be rated as risky. 

So doing this we can turn some categorical variables into continuous variables. 

The data set as of now is about 600,000 vouchers that have been audited over a ten year span. Currently about 8% of them have been rejected. But not all of the rejected ones were necessarily bad. We have two classes non compliance and saving. Savings are when the money is not due or at least some of it, bad math on the invoice, incorrect charges and so one. While non compliance don’t really save any money it’s just some account error, maybe they paid from the wrong funds, referenced the wrong contract or something. It’s gonna mess up the accounting system but not really save any money. About 20% of rejected vouchers have saving and 80% are non compliant. 

Obviously our goal is to identify vouchers that yield a saving. Even if we had a model that can predict all the improper ones, we just don’t have the resource to audit all of them. 

So my thoughts were to create a model fine tuned to have low false positive. Basically I would have a penalizing model for instances of an okay voucher being marked as improper. 

Obviously we’d miss some improper vouchers from that but we also don’t have the resource to audit them all anyway so my thought is this would allow us to focus on those that might be improper.

Looking for a decision-making framework ,1c32kuk,"I'm a data analyst working for a loan lender/servicer startup. I'm the first statistician they hired for a loan servicing department and I think I might be reinventing a wheel here.

The most common problem at my work is asking ""we do X to make a borrower perform better. Should we be doing that?""

For example when a borrower stops paying, we deliver a letter to their property. I performed a randomized A/B test and checked if such action significantly lowers a probability of a default using a two-sample binomial test. I also used Bayesian hypothesis testing for some similar problems.

However, this problem gets more complicated. For example, say we have four different campaigns to prevent the default, happening at various stages of delinquency and we want to learn about the effectiveness of each of these four strategies. The effectiveness of the last (fourth) campaign could be underestimated, because the current effect is conditional on the previous three strategies not driving any payments.

Additionally, I think I'm asking a wrong question most of the time. I don't think it's essential to know if experimental group performs better than control at alpha=0.05. It's rather the opposite: we are 95% certain that a campaign is *not* cost-effective and should be retired? The rough prior here is ""doing something is very likely better than doing nothing ""

As another example, I tested gift cards in the past for some campaigns: ""if you take action A you will get a gift card for that."" I run A/B testing again. I assumed that in order to increase the cost-effectives of such gift card  campaign, it's essential to make this offer time-constrained, because the more time a client gets, the more likely they become to take a desired action spontaneously, independently from the gift card incentive. So we pay for something the clients would have done anyway. Is my thinking right? Should the campaign be introduced permanently only if the test shows that we are 95% certain that the experimental group is more cost-effective than the control? Or is it enough to be just 51% certain? In other words, isn't the classical frequentist 0.05 threshold too conservative for practical business decisions?


1. Am I even asking the right questions here?
2. Is there a widely used framework for such problem of testing sequential treatments and their cost-effectivess? How to randomize the groups, given that applying the next treatment depends on the previous treatment not being effective? Maybe I don't even need control groups, just a huge logistic regression model to eliminate the impact of the covariates?

Predicting successful pharma drug launch,1c2tz99,"I have a dataset with monthly metrics tracking the launch of various pharmaceutical drugs.  There are several different drugs and treatment areas in the dataset, grouped by the lifecycle month.  For example:



|Drug|Treatment Area|Month|Drug Awareness (1-10)|Market Share (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|1|2|.05|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|2|3|.07|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|3|5|.12|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|...|...|...|
|XYZ|Psoriasis|18|6|.24|
|ABC|Psoriasis|1|1|.02|
|ABC|Psoriasis|2|3|.05|
|ABC|Psoriasis|3|4|.09|
|ABC|Psoriasis|...|...|...|
|ABC|Psoriasis|18|5|.20|
|ABC|Dermatitis|1|7|.20|
|ABC|Dermatitis|2|7|.22|
|ABC|Dermatitis|3|8|.24|

* Drugs XYZ and ABC may have been launched years apart, but we are tracking the month relative to launch date.  E.g. month 1 is always the first month after launch.
* Drug XYZ might be prescribed for several treatment areas, so has different metric values for each treatment area (e.g. a drug might treat psoriasis & dermatitis)
* A metric like ""Drug awareness"" is the to-date cumulative average rating based on a survey of doctors.  There are several 10-point Likert scale metrics like this
* The target variable is ""Market Share (%)"" which is the % of eligible patients using the drug
* A full launch cycle is 18 months, so we have some drugs that have undergone the full 18-month cycle can that be used for training, and some drugs that are currently in launch that we are trying to predict success for.

Thus, a ""good"" launch is when a drug ultimately captures a significant portion of eligible market share.  While this is somewhat subjective what ""significant"" means, let's assume I want to set thresholds like 50% of market share eventually captured.

Questions:

1. Should I model a time-series and try to predict the future market share?
2. Or should I use classification to predict the chance the drug will eventually reach a certain market share (e.g. 50%)?

My problem with classification is the difficulty in incorporating the evolution of the metrics over time, so  I feel like time-series is perfect for this.

However, my problem with time-series is that we aren't looking at a single entity's trend--it's a trend of several different drugs launched at different times that may have been successful or not.  Maybe I can filter to only successful launches and train off that time-series trend, but I would probably significantly reduce my sample size.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (REALM),1c29ri7,"I just came upon (what I think is) the original REALM paper, [“Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909). Really interesting idea, but there are some key details that escaped me regarding the role of the retriever. I was hoping someone here could set me straight:

1. **First and most critically, is retrieval-augmentation only relevant for generative models?** You hear a lot about RAG, but couldn’t there also be like RAU? Like in encoding some piece of text X for a downstream non-generative task Y, the encoder has access to a knowledge store from which relevant information is identified, retrieved, and then included in the embedding process to refine the model’s representation of the original text X? Conceptually this makes sense to me, and it seems to be what the REALM paper did (where the task Y was QA), but I can’t find any other examples online of this kind of thing. Retrieval-augmentation only ever seems to be applied to generative tasks. So yeah, is that always the case, or can RAU also exist?

2. **If a language model is trained using retrieval augmentation, that would mean the retriever is part of the model architecture, right?** In other words, come inference time, there must always be some retrieval going on, which further implies that the knowledge store from which documents are retrieved must also always exist, right? Or is all the machinery around the retrieval piece only an artifact of training and can be dropped after learning is done?

3. **Is the primary benefit of REALM that it allows for smaller model?** The rationale behind this question: Without the retrieval step, the 100% of the model’s latent knowledge must be contained within the weights of the attention mechanism (I think). For foundation models which are expected to know basically everything, that requires a huge number of weights. However if the model can inject context into the representation via some other mechanism, such as retrieval augmentation, the rest of the model after retrieval (e.g., the attention mechanism) has less work to do and can be smaller/simpler.

Advice and Resources Needed for Project on Auditing and Reversing LLMs employing coordinate ascent,1c28knv,"This may not be the right place to ask but really need advice.  

I am a college  student and I'm working on a project for Auditing LLMs by reversing an LLM and looking for prompt - output pairs. I want to know which model would suit my purpose .

For the academic purposes i intend to extend the experiment to other llms like Mistral, LLaMA ,  somw suggestions are welcome .

I am a beginner here and I have not worked on LLMs for prompting or optimization problems. I am really not sure how to progress and would appreciate any resources for performing experiments on LLMs.  

Also any concepts that i should know of ? .
Also im curious how do you usually run and train such models . Especially when there are constraints in computational power.

What's next for the quintessential DS role?,1c25koq,"This post is multiple questions wrapped into a single topic kind of thing which is why I thought best to keep it as an open-ended discussion.

  
**Q1.** When I see recent DS job postings a majority now have these two added requirements: 1. Some knowledge of LLMs. 2. Experience in NLP. I'm not sure if this is just biased based on what LinkedIn algorithm is showing me. But is this the direction that the average DS role is headed? I've always considered myself as a jack of all trades, flexible DS, but with no expertise is any technical vertical. Is the demand for the general data scientist role diminishing?  
  
**Q2.** In my 5 years of experience as a DS I've worked on descriptive analytics, predictive modelling, dash-boarding in consulting and product alike. Now, 5 years isn't that much time, but it's not too short either. I'm now finding myself working on similar types of problems (churn, risk, forecasting) and similar tools and workflows. This is not a complaint by any means, it is expected. But this got me thinking... Are there new tools and workflows out there that might enhance my current working setup?  For example: I sometimes find myself struggling to manage code for different variations of datasets used for different model versions. After loads of experimentation my directory is a mess. I'd love to know tools and workflows you use for typical DS problems.

Advice on what types of entry-level roles to seek,1c1yc8i,"Hello! 

I'm looking for some career advice on what types of roles to seek, resume help, and how to get feedback on an NLP Developer technical project that I completed. 

A little about me: I have a B.Sc. in CS, a data science internship (data visualization, data analysis, and LLM experience), and research experience (published in JMIR). I've been looking for work, full-time, for about a month and a half now, 170 applications sent, and minimal responses so far. **My end goal is to find a DS/ML role**. Something that will allow me to learn more technical skills in ML. I am primarily seeking remote roles in Canada and the United States, but am open to hybrid in my location. At some point, I plan on going back to school to receive an master's in CS specializing in ML, but at the moment, I'm looking to get more work experience.

The only response I've received so far is from an international company as NLP developer. I wrote a technical project for them, but sadly did not receive the role or any feedback on my submission. I have posted two examples of resumes that I might submit. I tailor my resume for each job, which usually means using an ATS checker and changing the summary/skills section to match the verbiage of the job. I'm looking for some advice:

**1)** At the moment, I'm casting a wide net in terms of roles. I've been applying to entry-level DA/DS/DE and ML related roles. Recently, I've focused a bit more on the DA roles, as I generally have all the skills they are asking for, and my data science internship involved a lot of dashboard building. That said, I am most interested in roles that involve ML (especially LLM and NLP).

I sometimes feel as though I'm selling myself short by applying so much to data analytics roles when I really want ML. **Should I continue to cast a wide net in terms of roles, or would it be better to focus more time on applying to only DS/ML roles?**

I should mention, time is of the essence, and work experience is so valuable in this market, so I would rather start working as a data analyst now than hold out for another year to find an ML role.

**2)** Related to Q1. I'm currently working on the Google Data Analytics Profesional cert, which I'm finding boring and easy. At this point, I will finish it, but I'm wondering what certs to take next. I could do more data analytics certs, but I was considering doing Andrew Ng's ML and DL certs on Coursea. **Would you recommend these certs, or any comments on other certs to take?**

**3)** **Do you have any suggestions on my resumes?** I know that it's a bit verbose in the skills section, but I'm trying to ensure that I make it through the initial screening if they are using AI.

**4)** **Where can I post my technical project for the NLP developer position that I applied to?** I would love to get some feedback on my submission, and I think it could be helpful for other Redditors looking for the same types of roles.

What realistically will be automated in the next 5 years for data scientists / ML engineers? Plus would love some career advice,1c1vciv,"Recently I’ve been job hunting and have hit the sad realization that I’ll have to take a salary cut if I want to work for a company with good ML practices. I have a lot of student loans from master’s program. 

I’ve been trying to keep up with LLM coding automations and software automators. It’s all beginning to seriously make me anxious but I think the probability I’m overreacting is at least 50%.

How much of a data scientist’s job do you think will be completely automated? Do you think we (recent master’s graduates with lots of debt) made the wrong choice? What areas can I strengthen to begin to future proof myself? Should I just chill out and just be ready to learn and adapt continuously?

My thinking is that I want to do more ML engineering or ML infra engineering even though right now I’m just a data scientist. It feels like this career path will pay off my loans, have some security, and also is better than dealing with business stakeholders sometimes. 

I am considering taking a bad pay cut to do more sophisticated ML where I’ll be building more scalable models and dealing with models in production. My thought process is this is the path to ML engineer. However my anxiety is terrifying me. Should I just not take the pay cut and continue to pay off loans + wait for a new opportunity? I fear the longer I wait, the worse my skills at a bad company become. Also would rather take a pay hit now and not in 1 year.

 My fear with taking pay cut is that I’ll be broke for a year and then in another year automations and coding bots might really become sophisticated. 

Anyways, if anyone’s knowledgeable would love to chat. This market and my loans are the most depressing realization ever

Career roadmap and advice please. Transitioning from Academia to DS.,1c1v5vc,"Hello!

I'm 46, Masters in Operations Research,  BS in Pure and Applied Math. I have been focusing on an academic career for a while, but lost my full-time professorship because I had problems with grading and meeting deadlines (I suffer from clinical depression). I am currently an adjunct math professor and cannot pay my bills. I love Applied Mathematics:, MDP, Game Theory, Simulation and I want to transition into some kind of Data Science field where I can learn more and utilize knowledge I have from grad school and more. I am not particularly interested in Finance or Medicine, and would find it much more interesting to work for physicists, chemists, biologists, economists, or other scientists. I am also very concerned about being able to acquire a career of this sort (and keeping it considering my depression). 

My current plan is to finish 4 Coursera specializations: Python, Data Science, Data Science with R, Intermediate Data Science; 3 textbooks: Probability and Statistics for Engineers (mostly a review, but my education heavily learns toward Modeling and Probability Theory rather than Statistics), Linear Models with R, and Acing the Data Science Interview. After doing a few projects and developing a portfolio, I hope that I can find an entry level position. Then, over the next 2-3 years I would like to study Machine Learning and finding the intersection with that and my OR background --Hopefully such a field exists. At this time I may get a second masters or maybe finish my PhD. Finally, I would hope to have a career when I turn 50.

I understand my depression is a big problem, but I am not going to just go on welfare and eek out an existence for the rest of my life. If you will, please look past this issue for the moment.

My current questions are: 
1) What is your opinion of my plan? Is it viable? What roadblocks might I encounter?
2) What job titles should I apply for as an entry-level data scientist? Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, MLOps, MLE.... I really don't know where I would fit.
3) Although I want to work for scientists, is this domain viable? Should I apply for my common domains like FAANG, Finance, or Medicine?
4) Ultimately, what job title should I be aiming for considering my interests.

Lastly, any other advice would be greatly appreciated!

Tough call: How important is choosing MSc Dissertation Topic in Data Science,1c18y1q," 

I'm 22-23 years old, currently at a crossroads in choosing my dissertation placement project for my MSc in Data Science and could really use your collective wisdom. One offers **stipend (3000 pounds**) (which I really want to take), others don't. Stipend provider project is about healthcare analytics with geospatial data (idk kind of not good career potential) and there is strong supervision, it will solve real life problem and might lead to **publications**. And then there is **offer from Bank of England** which offers no stipend, no supervision, not sufficient literature review (more work should be done on modelling) but aligns with my Economics bachelors, and would look good on CV. Since I want to do phd, I also have option of doing **internal dissertation project** which I can do on my interest field which is **Machine Learning** ( Developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from data)

Main: One of the options I'm considering is a project focused on ""Visualizing Geospatial Trachoma Diagnostic Data and Risk Factors."" This involves providing analytic and mapping support to a multi-country study on trachoma in countries like Zambia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Cameroon, and Nigeria.

Here's what I'd love to get your thoughts on:

1. How easy is it to transition between sectors (e.g., from healthcare to finance, tech, etc.) in data science? Does specializing early help or hinder long-term career flexibility?
2. Are the skills and experiences from a healthcare-focused project like this seen as valuable in other sectors within data science?
3. Have any of you made a sector switch in your data science career? What challenges did you face, and what advice would you have for someone early in their career?
4. For those of you who have worked on healthcare data or similar projects, what has been your experience? Would you recommend diving into such a niche, and why?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c18y1q/tough_call_how_important_is_choosing_msc/,Shirin-chay2001,5,Discussion,27,New
Why is it so hard to get neural networks to beat XGBoost on most small-medium tabular datasets?,1c10pqe,"I get it; XGBoost is really potent and easy to use while with DL theres a lot more that can go wrong tuning hyper parameters wise.

But i always assumed that whatever an ML model can do, a DL model with proper settings and sufficient regularization can also do as well even in low-medium size datsets (~hundreds to thoussnds of examples range).

I understand that DL models are more likely to overfit because theyre very very flexible espeically especially as width and parameter count goes up. Meanwhile, something like XGBoost tends to have just enough flexibioity to model complex patterns without overfitting.

At the same time, i thought that with sufficient regularization techniques like dropout, L1/L2, shrinking width etc, that a DL model should be able to generalize just as well even with small-medium datasets. 

Is it just that I havent found the correct combination of regularization and layer architecture? Or is it just that my assumption is wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1c10pqe/why_is_it_so_hard_to_get_neural_networks_to_beat/,WhiteRaven_M,140,Discussion,88,New
Capitulation | It's come to this,1c0zhd5,"wayy TLDR: 2023 Statistics, Finance, and Math grad with only one internship in tangentially related role. Can't find a job going on well over a year. Located in the US and is mostly location agnostic with a few preferences. Just trying all my options.

Hello, all. I sit here writing this post in disbelief that I am actuall doing this. Generally, in any given subreddit, I am a lurker. A year ago I would have shuddered at the thought of making a post like this. It goes against my nature to ask (beg?) for help from stangers--or, even from anybody at times. I feel as if I've done everything I can and am going insane trying to figure out where I am going wrong. Confiding in my close friend, I spoke of my troubles and experience in my job search (how I had done everything possible and such), and he suggested I make a post to this subreddit. To his credit, I had not done this yet and decided to exhaust all options I know of. I don't know what to expect, but I hope at the very least a see a perspective that allows me to push past the feelings (of what I can't really pinpoint anymore but despair, desperation, and any others you can name are probably there too).

This is my first post of this nature; so, being not sure of how to start, I will begin with an overview of myself and then attempt to consruct a coherent description of my situation. Details of the biography aren't unique to me or necessarily important to understanding my struggles, but, for anyone interested I figured it would save a few additional comments that I may have to make to give them.

I come from a very rural, impoverished area. Both my parents grew up even poorer than we are now, and neither went to college. My dad is a first-generation American so his life story has been quite rough as the family got here in the early 20th century (he is very old compared to my classmates fathers). I was lucky enough to have been born to two wonderful people who supported me in any way they could although not fully understanding the life I wanted--one away from poverty and where I could explore my interests with like-minded people. Luckily, I did exceptionally well in academics and found myself with an acceptance to a top ten undergrad program.

My thoughts (however misguided as there was no one I could have advise on this in highschool) were to go where the money was. Wallstreet. I had set out on studying finance my freshman year. My school  sends countless kids to the top Investment Banks every year and I thought that I should do that, get paid, find myself, and then transition to what ever industry I could if I wanted out. The school paid for a trek out to NYC and we got to go and visit all the big banks and meet with emloyees it was really fun. That was until someone told me about the work culture. This was the 2nd or third month of my freshman year so I was pretty ignorant with most things and when told about the working hours my stomach dropped. It seemed inhuman to work that much and for the price it didnt seem worth it. I struggled with this for a while and really started to enjoy the statistics class I was in. I'm sure you can guess where the rest of that story goes. I ended up switching to statistics; however, I still greatly enoyed finance and the classes were super interesting, so I kept finance for my other major. I also took several math classes past whats required for the minor but not quite the major but I enjoyed them regardless. I got to intern at INSEAD in Paris for a summer as a research assistant in statistics, so I thought I had a good chance to get some sort of data analyst/scientist/etc. role going into my senior year. Being an IB feeder school many of my classmates and friends had fulltime offers already and many more were expecting theres upon completing their upcoming internship. I however got nothing. I couldnt even find a professor that I could work for over the summer.

I went through junior summer jobless and scared. Everyone told me I would find a full time offer before graduating, but I didn't. I didn't care if it was for data/business analyst or data science or marketing data analyst etc. etc.

I was then graduated living at home with no income. My student loans (though very low) still were there and I began having to pay on those. There is no job I can get near me. I never had a car growing up and still dont. We just never had the money for that.

Luckily, there is an amazing alumni network that is always willing to help. Additonally, one of my professors I'm close with has made some good connections for me putting me in contact with some fantastic people who have helped me with interview prep, resume advice/editing, etc. The only thing they couldn't do is give me a referral as, upon looking there were no entry level roles for me that were open.

All of this was going on as I had life happening (as it does haha) This past summer I experienced the death of a close friend, a grandparent, and many other things. Job rejection and ghost after the other just hurt. I was lucky enough to a have a few go to an interview where I got to present my analysis to a team. Now they wont respond to my emails. It feels like some jobs just try to use applicants for free ideas without ever hiring them. Then, one day my girlfriend of 11 months facetimed me saying that she ""thinks it would be best if we didnt talk anymore"". I heard later through a friend that one of the reasons was my lack of ambition since i ""didn't even have a job yet and have the \[prestige of my undergrad\] to back me up"". Long story short, I did something very stupid and tried to take my life, but was stopped by cops who had been notified of a ""distressed person"". I was allowed to 201 myself and 2500 of my savings later, some therapy, and several months later, I feel much better and in control, but the frustration of getting a job still is there. I don't know what to do. I feel like I see everyone saying that referrals are the best way to get a job, which makes sense, but I have very excellent alumni helping and its still not doing it for me. Everyone I graduated with is on wallstreet now or at some consulting firm being overworked, but I just want to work. I like working I want to be sucessful. I sometimes wish I had just stayed with the crowd and not been such a baby about the working hours.

Looking at what I've written I realize it has gotten quite long. I don't want to be annoying, but I promised my friend I would do this. The simple act of posting this brings me much peace as I have exhausted this option. I'm not a big reddit poster/user, so apologies if I broke some unspoken rule or something of this sub. I wont exlain anymore in this initial post but will be happy to answer any commens or dms. I hope that this is somewhat coherent but writing it brought back a lot of memories I don't like to think of, so I did my best to get past it and just have something written down.

Shout-out to all you super competent Data Scientists out there!,1c0x106,"In the past, I've often commented that my domain expertise and working experience (i.e. in organic chemistry) is likely the thing that is / has been most valuable to my employers so far - with my Data Science skills being a second place. So, there's likely tons of data scientists that will run circles around me with their expertise in ML, programming, maths or statistics.

Today, I saw an (internal) job opening for a ""fully DS-centric"" Data Scientist position - the full shebang: multi-year-track record in diverse ML methods, experience in LLMs, fullly business-savy, proven track-record, excellent communicator, experienced in change management).

This is not the position for me. I'm happy and content with my job and with how things are going for me; I'm good at what I do. I like the niche that I have created for myself.

Still, it made me realise *how effing competent* some of you guys out there really are in your respective domains! So, I just wanted to say, well done you! Keep at it! 🧡

The best place to network as a Data Scientist,1c0uyvo,"Hi all,  
In a week, I'll be flying to the States. I'm looking for nice places to network as a senior DS with over 10 yrs of experience in consulting, management but mostly in building AI products (I tend to favour Python over meetings). I'll be visiting Washington and New York and have 2 weeks time. Things on my list:

- a DS conference (in Washington on AI in finance; will not post the link as this may seem like a hidden commercial, which it is not),  
- several meetups in NY as it seems to be the place with the most vacancies,  
- I want to go to workspots/techhubs/incubators to network and I also have to do some work. Any recommendations for places that actually stimulate networking (not WeWork and the likes) are highly appreciated!  
- I actually got the advice to go to a gym where a lot of rich tech people go called equinox. Not sure how serious I should take that. But I like weird stuff like that as it might also lead to some surprise connections.  
- Any good hostels where a lot of nomads/tech people live would also be nice.

Let me know if this resonates with you and/or if you have any feedback.

Much appreciated!

A Tale of Two Cultures: Integrating Data Science and MLOps to Build Successful ML Products,1c0rhdm," When the excitement about data science became widespread about 10 years ago, this spurred a lot of proof-of-concept ideas. However, most of these stayed confined in Jupyter notebooks and never made it into production. There are multiple reasons why it has been a lot harder than initially expected to productionize ML models, but the one I want to focus on in this blog post is one that has not been explored in as much depth. In order to create business value, we have to marry two very different approaches: The ML lifecycle starts out on the exploratory data science side, but we eventually have to transition towards an engineering-driven approach in order to achieve the quality attributes such as availability, reliability, scalability, and security typically expected of production systems. Thus, what it takes to do good work in data science is fundamentally opposed to what it takes to do good work in MLOps, giving rise to different best practices, skill sets, and even mentalities (ways of thinking about problems) on each side. As a result, a central challenge for creating successful ML products is to find a good process for making these two different cultures work well together. 

This is very detailed article by  *Thomas Loeber, Senior Machine Learning Engineer at*  Logic20/20, Inc.

Time series train test split,1c0exqh,"Hi all,
Suppose I have 6 months of data at weekly level (24 data points) and I want to forecast for the next two weeks.

If Im doing a train test split keeping let’s say 4 data points for validation. With this setting suppose i get a good arima or ets model.

My question is, at the time of forecasting, I’m actually predicting for the next 6 weeks then (4 in validation, 2 in prediction). Time series models become less reliable the further into the future you predict. 

In such a scenario, is train test split for time series something we should be trying out?

Is anyone familiar with the state of the academic job market for data science/ML/statistics?,1c05xju,"I frequently peruse [r/AskAcademia](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/) and they always talk about how getting a tenure-track job these days is a pipe dream. They frequently cite some statistic (not sure where it's from) that 2% of graduating PhD's get a tenure-track job. They also say that even when filtered to just STEM fields, this figure is somewhere around 9-10%.

I'm in the early stages of a PhD in statistics with research focus in ML at a fairly reputable program. My professors have all told me that getting a tenure-track academic job should be very doable, since I have no restrictions as to where I can/can't live and have a good advisor who I'm doing productive research with. They always say that because so many students in the field take higher-paying jobs in industry, there's a little bit less competition for those who want to get into academia. Which does make sense.

How much does degree title matter vs skills and classes taken for an MS?,1c02l55,"I'm (an American) in a biostatistics MS program, but I have the opportunity to finish early by a summer and a fall semester (7 months) with my departments online ""applied statistics and data science"" MS. The research that I've been apart of has mostly been data cleaning and building an R package to submit to CRAN. I've basically finished the core classes for our PhD, but I'm more interested in math heavy software development than original research. Tech skills: Python, R, SAS, and I'm rusty on PHP, JS/React, SQL, which I used years ago for past projects.

Desperately need feedback to land a job in ML/NLP asap,1c02doz,"People of datascience, I'm looking for some feedback on my  resume. I'm in the second year of my university (online university)  while I'm full-time self studying Machine Learning with a heavy focus on  natural language processing. My goal is to land a job as soon as  possible, ideally as an NLP engineer while I continue my studies and  then I plan on getting a masters degree in AI to get into academic  research.   

I know that getting a job now might not be the best way to break  into academic research, rather focusing on my degree is a much better  way, however, given my life situation in general especially financial,  it's very important for me to get a full-time job and make money while I  spend next 3 years completing my bachelors degree along side.   

These next 3 years I have to settle my kitchen income first before I  can move towards academic research. In these 3 years, industry  experience might help me with immigration to move to a foreign country  where I may get a better and more sophisticated job and enroll in  masters degree in some good university, or if not, then moving abroad  for studies is the second option (student visa).   

I need advice on how I can plan a few months ahead so that I can  land a full-time job as soon as possible, since my current internship is  unpaid, and also because it's a startup which is not generating much  revenue as of now, I don't really think they can afford to hire me  full-time.

Syllabus for school,1bzp8eg,"I'm involved in developing a syllabus in data science for young people (aged around 16). It will be defined at three levels (let's call it levels 1, 2 and 3). I'm happy with the data science content but would like guidance about the statistical content.

The course will be short (40 hours) so there's not a great deal of time for statistics, given that the focus of the course is data science (tools, techniques, methods, processes, etc.). However, there is some time (5 hours?) for some stats at each level.

At this time my inclination is:

Level 1: simple descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, max, min, range.

Level 2: Level 1 plus: percentiles, IQR.

Level 3: Level 2 plus: variance, standard deviation (z scores).

I'm tempted to introduce probability because it's fundamental to data science. What do you think about that? Also correlation?

I appreciate that this omits inferential statistics but given the time constraints I can't see how to fit that in. But I accept that linear regression would be nice at Level 3.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bzp8eg/syllabus_for_school/,bobbyelliottuk,0,Education,20,New

After a little talk we had about using ChatGPT and Github Copilot my boss (the head of the data-science team) decided that in order to make sure that we are not missing useful tool and in order not to stay behind he wants me (as the one with a Ph.D. in the group I guess) to make a little research about what possibilities does AI tools bring to the data-science role and I should present my finding and insights in a month from now.

From what I've seen in my field so far LLMs are way better at NLP tasks and when dealing with tabular data and plain statistics they tend to be less reliable to say the least. Still, on such a fast evolving area I might be missing something. Besides that, as I said, those gaps might get bridged sooner or later and so it feels like a good practice to stay updated even if the SOTA is still immature.

So - what is your take? What tools other than using ChatGPT and Copilot to generate python code should I look into? Are there any relevant talks, courses, notebooks, or projects that you would recommend?

Three Practical Use Cases of Machine Learning and Digital Twins in Clinical Research and Care,1bz20r9,"Hi all, thought my most recent Substack post would be of interest to those working in the healthcare/life sciences space. I talk about how we can use big data and machine learning to bring more personalized care through what’s called “digital twins.” Essentially, it uses historical data to look at the outcomes of people who share similar characteristics to you. Using Alzheimer’s Disease as a motivating example, there’s three use-cases for digital twins I discuss in my post:

1. Reducing the size of randomized trial control arms through the prediction of treatment arm outcomes via their digital twins. The company with the most work on this space that I know of is [Unlearn.ai](https://www.unlearn.ai/). This would ideally save recruitment time and costs that scale per patient and per site.
2. Using digital twins to calculate a prognostic score of disease progression and, in a trial, recruiting only those who are more likely to rapidly progress. In the literature, this is often called “enrichment.” When people progress at a faster rate, we can run the trial for less time while still having a good chance to observe a treatment effect if it’s there. 
3. Using digital twins to help inform the delivery of precision medicine in routine care (e.g. at the doctor’s office). Crucially, this system should be tested in randomized trials versus standard of care.

If any of these topics interest you, [check out the post here](https://open.substack.com/pub/mlinhealthcare/p/leveraging-machine-learning-using?r=7bxky&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)!

I searched for a tool or library that would help me do this and was astonished to find no such thing! I took it into my own hands and decided to make it myself.

## Target Audience

This project is useable in its current state, and always looking for more feedback/features from the community!

## Comparison

There are no other similar alternatives AFAIK

Here is the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/NFeruch/reddit2text](https://github.com/NFeruch/reddit2text)

It's also available to download through pip/pypi :D

Some basic features:

1. Gathers the authors, upvotes, and text for the OP and every single comment
2. Specify the max depth for how many comments you want
3. Change the delimiter for the comment nesting

Here is an example truncated output: [https://pastebin.com/mmHFJtcc](https://pastebin.com/mmHFJtcc)

Under the hood, I relied heavily on the PRAW library (python reddit api wrapper) to do the actual interfacing with the Reddit API. I took it a step further though, by combining all these moving parts and raw outputs into something that's easily useable and very simple.

LLM APIs vs Hosting OSS/Fine-tuned models,1bxfed8,"Hi guys, just want to check my line of thinking.



I'm managing a DS/ML team in my company, and we've been picking up a couple of projects that uses LLM.

To date, I see that for the applications happening inside the company, using LLM APIs (OpenAI, Google, etc) and building systems around it (RAG, guardrails, prompting, you name it) is still the way to go because of:

- Speed to iterate

- Fine-tuning data not readily available

- The current + foreseeable future use cases seems to be able to be solved using ""general knowledge"" contained in the big tech's pretraining + instruct-tuning

I still see fine-tuning being thrown around by either the big tech sales people (I get it, they're sales function at the end of the day) or by senior leadership that knows a bit into the details behind these LLMs, but personally I don't see a specific value yet of doing fine-tuning at my company's scale.



The reasons I can think of on why someone in my position resorts to fine tuning is:

- If there is an available infrastructure + team managing it already, and serving our own fine-tuned model is cheaper (economy of scale).

- Compliance issues (eg. maybe Banks really don't want to risk their data being sent to other company's server)

- Risk of the model's response stability being at the hand of the provider

- If the task is proven to be too specific, and even GPT-4/Opus/Gemini-1.5 with RAG, etc can't solve (or the modifications around it becoming too expensive)



Based on your experience, is there a major reason that I miss? Another recent data point is Cognition labs. If people at their caliber wrap their system around GPT-4, why should I bother with fine-tuning?

I just can't fine tune BERT over 40% accuracy for text-classification task,1bx5q8g,"Hi everyone, this is the first time I'm fine tuning an LLM and I just can't get over 40% accuracy for the text-classification task.

I'm using BERT from transformers library to load and train the model and peft for LoRA implementation. My data set contains English written summaries of news articles and with each article there is a label such as Economics, Politics, Science, Entertainment, etc... (14 unique labels). The maximum length of summaries can extend up to 250-300 tokens. My training set has 800 examples and validation set has 200 examples.

At first the training loss was reaching very low but the validation loss was not going too low with validation accuracy going maximum up to 45%. Since it was overfitting, I changed dropout rate form 0.1 to 0.5. After that the model is not overfitting now, but it is underfitting, with validation and training loss being almost the same and validation accuracy still reaching 45% max.

I tried removing LoRA implementation but nothing changed, except for the training time. At this point I'm confused as to what should I do. I've tried tuning hyperparameters but nothing changes.

Can anyone help me out in understanding what possibly could I be missing here. I can share stats and code implementation or I can even get on call if that's possible. Any help will be very much appreciated.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the input. Most of all were right about insufficient data and class imbalance, since the classes were not even evenly distributed. So, I changed the dataset and used a much larger set of data with 70k examples approx. and turns out, I got an accuracy of 88.45% on validation set.

upskilling for ex-academic with skill gaps,1bwno6f,"Hey folks, I’m looking for advice on filling in some skill gaps. I’m a social science academic with a highly quantitative background, left academia a couple years ago for a nonprofit role, and am now looking for my next thing.

My job search revealed that I have some noticeable skill gaps that affect interviewing and hiring. But typical data science training options are pitched too low — I’m qualified/have been recruited to teach subjects like causal inference, experiment design, surveys, data viz, and R programming at the grad level. I’d like to upskill on at least the following topics:

* ⁠Python, but the intro stuff is just unbearably boring. Is there a Python transition course for R experts?

* SQL, ditto. I fully understand most concepts around data manipulation …. in R.

 * ⁠Forecasting and predictive analytics. Would be happy to read a book or take a class on this.

* ⁠Product oriented analytics. I’m solid on working with non-technical stakeholders but there seem to be some common issues (churn, pricing, auctions, marketing/attribution, risk, search) where specific knowledge of how people typically approach the problems would be helpful.

* AI/ML basics and assessment. Again, looking for stuff for someone with minimal ML experience but a strong stats/quant background. 



Also interested in anything you think would be a good direction to pursue. I’m not currently in a hurry, plus the market is miserable, so I’d like to set myself up for a big push next year.

Deduplication with SPLINK,1bwmh4t,"I'm trying to figure out a way to deduplicate a large-ish dataset (tens of millions) of records, and SPLINK was recommended. It looks very solid as an approach, and some comparisons are already well defined.

This will help with blocking the data into more manageable chunks, but the real comparisons I want are some multi-classification fields. 

These have large dictionaries behind them. An example would be a list of ingredients. There might be 3000 ingredients in the dictionary, and any entry could have 1 or more ingredients. I want to design a comparator that looks at the intersection of the sets of ingredients listed, but I'm having trouble with how to define this in SQL and what format to use. If I can block by ""must have at least one ingredient in common"" and use a Jaccard-like measure of similarity I would be pretty happy, I'm just struggling with how to define it.

Need guidance for (lack of) career path,1bwlye4,"I'm at a loss of where I stand in the Data Analyst career path. I did an econ MA in 2019 immediately after finishing my BA, which was a terrible idea because I was playing catchup on the maths and couldn't really properly learn any of econ models or causal inference/statistics.

After graduating I struggled to find an ""Econ"" job while my peers got positions months before graduation. Thanks to Twitter hobby-posting during the start of COVID though, I got my first gig as a Data Analyst late 2020 with the Dept of Health. Thats when I started self teaching Python alongside PowerBI and Tableu. More recently I've picked up SQL and R...

Fast forward to now, I've been through about a job per year and I am once again not too happy with the position I am in. I'm a glorified data wrangler at my mental health research lab, which has a small 3 person data analyst team (4 if we cound the boss/director). I get barraged with so much ad-hoc stuff that I can't say no to that I don't have time to revisit all the modelling/causal inference stuff I didn't fully grasp during my MA... nor does anyone really care about my opinion in that topic. I've had countless instances of cases where, despite not know how to fix an issue, I call out an issue in an analysis that is egregious (ex: operating on a dataset for which, due to issues with my peer's R code, only 30% of observations had an IPTW and the rest where NULL, when none should be NULL). No one ever cares - they are in the well-known social sciences loop of ""shit out as many papers as possible, or perish due to lack of grants"".

Whenever I do get the chance to go beyond data wrangling, I'm basically sent on fishing expeditions that we use to show some silly model in a silly one-time presentation never to be revisited. 

I have insisted at times for my name not to be included on a paper we submit to journals, but they always get me included because I can't get myself to say ""the reason is you have a lot of issues in there, which I pointed out and you chose to ignore. I don't wanna be victim to a replication crisis blogpost"". It's demoralizing and I can't continue this way for longer.

It seems all academic-ish jobs in social sciences are like this, from what I've read on forums. But I just don't have the skillset to make it as a ""Data Scientist"" in industry either...and I don't have the time to fill the gaps while I'm working because I'm always data monkeying away, and often times reading a shitton of documentation that wears me out from being able to get into my Statistics bookmarks after work...Right now I have been tasked with figuring out our datawarehouse, which is prepared in fucking SAS-SQL and has dozens of SAS programs each with copies like `code_v1` thru `code_v16_final_FINAL` - the person that did all that work for years, and was my mentor when I joined the lab, abruptly quit recently.

What should I do? I have savings...My partner is OK with me quitting to figure things out. But I'm not sure I am. I need a plan, at the very least, before doing that... I've considered proposing they have me as a part time employee, or just returning to my previous job for which I had similar issues but they weren't in this magnitude...

If it matters below is my ""career path"" thus far. I've an Econ/IR double BA and an Applied Econ MA...


1. COVID contact tracing team - ended after 1 year because politics
2. Development NGO - quit after accepting job on #3 because my pay would be doubled, plus I was like 3 additional unpaid roles there on top of DA
3. Govt. transparency, civic participation, econ development think tank - quit after getting told I couldn't work remotely from the state I wanted fo move to so I could move in with my long distance partner. However they did ask me to rejoin 1 month later and I said no...still in good terms

Opinions on a side project for a recent grad?,1bwexfq,"Hey everyone 👋 

I’m graduating in 4 weeks. Got an analyst role, but I eventually want to land a DS role. Was thinking of taking a gap year and getting an MS degree in CS with an emphasis on ML from Georgia Tech.  In that year, I wanted to work on a side project. 

I was honestly thinking of teaching myself object oriented programming and making a video game without an engine, just using hard coding.  I know that’s not DS related, but I’ll be doing plenty of analytical stuff with SQL/Python/Tableau at my day job.

"You are under arrest, you can be released if and only if, you explain p-values the right way.",1bw2ppe,"So, I asked chatGPT this:  
 ""I know, And you know, that you have been trained on a lot of data from reddit. Pretend you are a tough critic on datascience sub and validate my statements:  I am studying p-value, in ab testing and in hypothesis testing in general, here's my interpretation to it: Given a chance model that embodies the null hypothesis, the p-value is the probability of obtaining results as unusual or extreme as the observed results.  How wrong am I ?""

&#x200B;

And here's its reply:

 

Your interpretation of the p-value is essentially correct and aligns well with standard statistical definitions. Let's break it down a bit more for clarity and completeness, especially from the perspective of a critical view one might encounter in discussions, say, on the data science subreddit:

1. **Definition Accuracy**: The p-value measures the probability of observing results as extreme as, or more extreme than, what was actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Your description captures this essence correctly. It's important to emphasize that this is under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
2. **Context of 'Extreme'**: The term ""as unusual or extreme"" is accurately used here. In statistical testing, ""extreme"" is defined in the context of the null hypothesis. What constitutes ""extreme"" is determined by the test statistic used and its distribution under the null hypothesis. It's not just about being unusual; it's about being so far from what the null hypothesis predicts that it prompts a second look.
3. **Not the Probability of the Null Hypothesis Being True**: A common misconception about p-values that's important to avoid is thinking that the p-value tells you the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false. Your statement avoids this pitfall by correctly not making claims about the truth of the null hypothesis itself. The p-value doesn't provide direct evidence about the truth of the null or alternative hypotheses; it's about the evidence against the null hypothesis given the data.
4. **Implications for Decision Making**: While not directly stated in your interpretation, it's essential to recognize that a small p-value indicates that, if the null hypothesis were true, the observed result would be surprising. However, deciding on a threshold for ""small"" (like p < 0.05) is somewhat arbitrary and should be considered in the context of the field of study, the stakes of the decision, and the study design.
5. **Misinterpretations and Limitations**: It's also worth noting, especially in a critical discussion, that p-values are widely misunderstood and misused. They should not be used in isolation for making decisions. Other factors, including the effect size, the study design, the data quality, and the pre-study probabilities of the hypotheses, are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the study's results.

Your interpretation of the p-value as the probability of obtaining results as unusual or more extreme than the observed results, under the null hypothesis, is a concise and correct starting point. Expanding upon this with an awareness of common misunderstandings and the context of its application will deepen the understanding and communication of statistical results.

S company is just beginning to implement AI, and the vacancy is for a senior-level position. As a data scientist, I would need to identify opportunities to apply AI. They lack an MLOps platform but promise freedom to deploy and use technologies as needed, with minimal bureaucracy. This seems appealing for rapid growth within the company. However, the downside is the limited number of experienced data scientists in the team (only one, actually). S company, focusing on package delivery, has many opportunities to apply optimization algorithms for routing. Yet, I've noticed the company seems somewhat disorganized.

B company, is a large bank known for being data-driven, frequently hosts insightful conferences on ML and DS on YouTube. The vacancy relates to credit limits, and I was told that specializing in credit and loans is crucial for advancement within this company. The position is mid-level and offers a higher salary than S company. This could be advantageous, as it allows for learning without excessive pressure. However, I wonder if becoming too specialized in this area might limit my future career options.

Does anyone knows how to scrape post on Reddit thread into Python for data analysis?,1bvi2wf," 

Hi does anyone knows how to scrape post on Reddit thread into Python for data analysis? I tried to connect python into the reddit server and this is what i got. Does anyone know how to solve this issue?

After the user authorizes the app and Reddit redirects to the specified redirect URI with a code parameter, you need to extract that code from the URL.

For example, if the redirect URI is http://localhost:65010/authorize\_callback  
, and Reddit redirects to a URL like http://localhost:65010/authorize\_callback?code=example\_code&state=unique\_state  
, you would need to parse the code  
parameter from the URL, which in this case is 'example\_code'.

Once you have extracted the code, you need to use it to obtain the access token by making a POST request to Reddit's API token endpoint. This endpoint is usually something like [https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access\_token](https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token).

Here's a general outline of how you can do it:

1. Extract the code parameter from the redirect URI.
2. Make a POST request to Reddit's API token endpoint with the code, along with your app's client ID, client secret, redirect URI, and grant type (which is typically 'authorization\_code'  
).
3. Reddit's API will respond with an access token.
4. You can then use this access token to authenticate requests to the Reddit API.

The specific details of making the POST request, handling the response, and using the access token will depend on the programming language and libraries you are using. You'll need to refer to Reddit's API documentation for the exact endpoints, parameters, and response formats.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bvi2wf/does_anyone_knows_how_to_scrape_post_on_reddit/,honghuiying,0,Tools,9,New
"(Need Advice) Got a job offer after a long time off, need tips on negotiating. ",1bvcjcp,"Hi, I would like some advice/perspective on my situation if you would be so kind! 

I left my previous position 22 months ago due to a toxic new director. There, I was making 84K with 4.5 weeks of PTO. It went from at office to once a week after the pandemic hit. I have drained all of my savings at this point. I have been searching with little luck, even with 6 years of experience. 

A CEOof a local company reached out to me on LinkedIn, and we had some good conversations. He asked what my rate was, and I told him 100K - 110K. He seems genuinely interested in being data driven to expand into new territory. He was impressed with what I did with his test data, and I feel like he would be a good boss. He currently works remotely, but he plans to move to my city in the summer. 

He called an hour ago to extend an offer. The offer is 70K plus 20% bonus. I told him that's within range (probably a mistake). I also brought up that I would like to work remote by default. I could come into the office if needed for a meetinf or task, but that I was healthier and more productive working from home (I lost 40-50 pounds when my previous organization went remote). He said that he felt that would hurt productivity, and that flexibility may be available but he doesn't want to say yes because he can't ""condone"" it. I said that was not a deal breaker (also probably a mistake). We ended the call with him saying that he was going to send the offer letter over and that he wanted to call ""so you wouldn't be surprised.""

I went from feeling excited to feeling anxious and disappointed. The salary, even with bonus, was not what I was making at my previous position in 2022. Which I think I would be okay with... If I could work remote even 3 days a week. His resistance to the idea of even working remote on days where it would be helpful to be home (like apartment maintenance or vet appointments) was also very disheartening. Add also that there are only 2 weeks of PTO in the offer letter I just received. 

After talking with a friend, I have decided to at least make a counter offer for the salary. I want to ask for 85K plus the bonus. What I really want is a 2 on/3 out of office schedule. I am thinking about saying I appreciate the offer but the offer is less than I made in the previous position and that I would be happy with either 85 plus the bonus or 2/3 hybrid schedule. My fear is that he becomes resentful of my asking for the hybrid given his stance of it. My lesser fear is that they say no, I take it anyway, and that sets up a weird power dynamic that I am on the losing end of. He knows I've been looking for a while, so I don't really have leverage. I do have Adhd, and I susoect autism as well, but I don't know how to bring that up as an additional reason to allow remote work. 

I would love to hear feedback on negotiating offers in general and also negotiating for hybrid specifically. I would also like to hear perspective from people who moved on from their organizations after 4-12 months if full time office affects my mentality that drastically.

[Need advice]I Want to Leave MAANG a Month After Being Hired,1buvnuw,"(Hope this is the right subreddit as many people post job-related/job-seeking questions. If not, I'm sorry, that's an honest mistake.)

Hello everyone. I was recently hired by one of the big corporations, and I would appreciate advice from the community.

I was offered a high-level DS manager position at one of the MAANG companies. During the hiring process, I discussed with the hiring manager that I would start as an individual contributor, focusing on helping to improve the recommendation engine. Several months later, I was supposed to transition into managing a small team. I was extremely excited, it’s MAANG, after all.

However, on my very first day of the job, my manager’s peer informed me that there had been a reorg. As a result, the tasks we had initially discussed would not be happening. To make matters worse, it turned out that my manager’s planned promotion didn’t materialize, leaving no team for me to manage. I thought, “Okay, I can live with this. Worst-case scenario, I’ll transfer to another team later.”

Fast forward two weeks, and I honestly hate it. The tools we use are awful. Simple tasks that would take minutes outside of big tech now take up to an hour because our small databases constantly crash under load. Even building a basic causal model becomes incredibly challenging because we can’t extract data from the database for a sufficiently long period. When I raised these concerns with my manager, their response was, “I’m not a fan of complex modeling. If you want to do that, let’s outsource it to the Data Engineering (DE) team.”

What’s more, my daily work involves adding charts to dashboards and handling ad hoc requests from various stakeholders. Nobody can clearly state our long-term goals or what we’re trying to achieve. Our OKRs are DAU and Revenue, which are essentially driven by other company products (lol). The most disconcerting part is that every other Data Scientist in our part of the organization seems to be doing the same — ad-hocs, reports, and dashboards. Frankly, this doesn’t feel like DS work at all.

In my previous workplace, I held the responsibility of creating models and introducing new ways to leverage data to increase our KPIs. My team was first to introduce causal modeling and ML-based user segmentation, we’ve also piloted several other things that involved shipping models to production. When I decided to leave, my employer has repeated several times that should anything go wrong, I shouldn’t hesitate and come back to working for them. I’m seriously consider this option now. By the way it wasn't a small shop, that was an international company with petabytes of data and over a billion of revenue per year. Not the MAANG level though.

My current job offers better compensation, particularly if I can vest my stock options. However, during these several weeks, we’ve already experienced another reorganization (3rd or 4th in 1.5 years), making it highly unlikely that I’ll vest before the next round of layoffs.

What would be the right move? To those familiar with MAANG companies, I’d appreciate your insights. Is this situation normal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1buvnuw/need_advicei_want_to_leave_maang_a_month_after/,Deep-Technology-6842,111,Career Discussion,101,New
Help with Multiple Linear Regression for product cannibalization.,1but6uu,"I briefly studied this in college, and chat gpt has been very helpful, but I’m completely out of my depth and could really use your help. 

 We’re a master distributor that sells to all major US retailers. 

I’m trying to figure out if a new product is cannibalizing the sales of a very similar product. 

I’m using multiple linear regression. 

Is this the wrong approach entirely?

Data base: Walmart year- Week as integer (higher means more recent), Units Sold Old Product , Avg. Price of old product, Total Points of Sale of Old Product where new product has been introduced to adjust for more/less distribution, and finally, unit sales of new product. 

So everything is aggregated at a weekly level, and at a product level. I’m not sure if I need to create dummy variables for the week of the year.

The points of sale are also aggregated to show total points of sale per week instead of having the sales per store per week. Should I create dummy variables for this as well?

I’m analyzing only the stores where the new product has been introduced. Is this wrong?

I’m normalizing all of the independent variables, is this wrong? Should I normalize everything? Or nothing?

My R^2 is about 15-30% which is what’s freaking me out.  I’m about to just admit defeat because the statistical “tests” chatgpt recommended all indicate linear regression just aint it bud. 

The coefficients make sense (more price less sales), more points of sale more sales, more sale of new product less sale of old.

My understanding is that the tests are measuring how well it’s forecasting sales, but for my case I simply need to analyze the historical relationship between the variables. Is this the right way of looking at it? 

Edit: Just ran mode with no normalization and got an R2 of 51%. I think Chat Gpt started smoking something along the process that just ruined the entire code. Product doesn’t seem to be cannibalizing, seems just extremely price sensitive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1but6uu/help_with_multiple_linear_regression_for_product/,realbigflavor,49,Analysis,26,New

Categorical Root Cause Analysis,1bub0hm,"Hi everyone,

We're trying to solve a problem that I feel should be rather generic, and for some reason I can't seem to find good material about.

So the problem goes like this: we have a certain metric that we want to maximize, within a range of 0-100%. This metric is computed as the percentage of 1s in a binary column in our dataset. All of the other columns are categorical features, with varying cardinalities. Some might have 3 possible values, some dozens or even hundreds. 

I would like to perform Root Cause Analysis, so that I can tell my stakeholders ""Here's what's causing a decrease in the overall metric, go fix it"". However, all of the RCA content I find online handles numerical features, while mine are all categorical. And there's no trivial way to make them numeric, as in, there's no order applicable to their values.

So what I try to do currently, is look for 'segments' in the data that are underperforming. A segment means any combination of feature values over perhaps just 1, or some, or all features. I chose to call these 'segments', if there's a well-known term for this I would love to be corrected and educated.

Now, since my features may have a high cardinality, the number of segments to look through is potentially huge, so an exhaustive search is off the table.

Question number 1: Is this a common problem that has a known optimal solution? An algorithm or perhaps even a library that implements it that I can just use?

So here's what we did to solve this problem in our use-case, and I'd love to hear opinions or suggestions:

We one-hot encode all of our data, train an XGBoost (what else...) model on the whole dataset, then use SHAP values to extract the knowledge that our model gained. We recommend to our users the feature-value pairs with the highest mean SHAP values, as the most likely culprits.

To allow for some combinations to be looked at, we use our top 5 feature-value pairs as filters (one at a time), then run the same logic on each data subset. This produces 5 new top-SHAP feature-value pairs, and we do the same once again. This gives us at most 3 levels of combination. But, I worry that we might be missing other niche segments that are badly underperforming because we got to the 'niche' segments by drilling down from higher-level feature-values.

Anyway, hopefully this isn't becoming too confusing. I'd love to hear thoughts or perhaps some of you have faced similar challenges in the past and have some recommendations.

Nature: No installation required: how WebAssembly is changing scientific computing,1btl6ei,"WebAssembly is a tool that allows users to run complex code in their web browsers, without needing to install any software. This could revolutionize scientific computing by making it easier for practitioners to share data and collaborate.

Python, R, C, C++, Rust and a few dozen languages can be compiled into the WebAssembly (or Wasm) instruction format, allowing it to run in a software-based environment inside a browser.

The article explores how this technology is being applied in education, scientific research, industry, and in public policy (at the FDA). 

And of course, it's early days; let's have reasonable expectations for this technology; ""porting an application to WebAssembly can be a complicated process full of trial and error — and one that’s right for only select applications.""

As you can imagine, it’s painfully dull and low paying aside from the advantage of good LSB (9-5). I’ve been working on a way to automate my work with python scripts, but aside from this there is really not much to add to my resume. 

My overall goal is to move to a backoffice positon in risk/investment research unit in my bank where they do something more quantitative like analytics, modelling and statistical analysis. What else could I be doing to get there in the future?

How do I know when to stop hyper parameter tuning and try something else?,1bro6ep,"Edit: its for deep learning just to clarify; im referencing stuff like messing around with a CNN's architecture, activation, optimizer, learning rate, regularizers, etc

I feel like i understand the math and algorithm behind model architectures quite well; i take care to preprocess and clean data, but in practice i struggle to get good performance. I always just end up manually tuning hyper parameters or using gridsearch for days or weeks with minimal improvement in erformance. 

I guess my question is: how do I know if i just need to keep going until i find some good combination of hyper params or if i just need to be trying something else?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bro6ep/how_do_i_know_when_to_stop_hyper_parameter_tuning/,WhiteRaven_M,50,ML,37,New
"Are there any DA/DS-adjacent roles (other than dev roles requiring a lot of Leetcode) that are in-demand, preferably low-code ones?",1brmr5o,"Hello, I've been working in educational technology for over a decade and have a useless MSDS (graduated December 2022). I desperately need a new career. What can I learn that my MSDS might help me in, something that I could combine it with? Scrum master? I've read that RPA is dead, is that right? Anything along those lines?

I am really good at things like project management, communicating with people, understanding client needs and putting them into writing, making business use case arguments, leading teams, writing and maintaining documentation, and related soft skills. I understand what is going on with different pieces of technology at a higher level but am not great at the nitty-gritty of it. I am fine with basic Python/SQL (and can keep learning programming in general to improve) but I hate Leetcode and really don't want to have to learn it. I do not see myself as a hardcore programmer who's going to learn 800 hard Leetcode questions...and I don't think anyone else does, either. lol

Of course I know viz tools as well like Tableau, PowerBI, Looker etc. 

Looking for something for which there is actually a demand, so no entry level data analysis. Am also okay if it's not super related to DA/DS.

Basic modelling question,1brlkvl,"Hi All,

I am working on subscription data and i need to find whether a particular feature has an impact on revenue.

&#x200B;

The data looks like this (there are more features but for simplicity only a few features are presented):

&#x200B;

|id|year|month|rev|country|age of account (months)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2023|1|10|US|6|
|1|2023|2|10|US|7|
|2|2023|1|5|CAN|12|
|2|2023|2|5|CAN|13|

&#x200B;

Given the above data, can I fit a model with y = rev and x = other features?

I ask because it seems monthly revenue would be the same for the account unless they cancel. Will that be an issue for any model or do I have to engineer a cumulative revenue feature per account and use that as y? or is this approach completely wrong?

The idea here is that once I have the model, I can then get the feature importance using PDP plots.

Thank you

Maybe we're using too much data to train models,1br0kjc,"If you make the weak analogy between LLMs and humans / other organisms, we find that the LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data. So much so that a human being may never process that much information over their developmental years. Of course, the brain seems to be a foundation model that has been trained over all of its ascendant's data, which could be argued to be much more than all of the internet. But I don't think the information coming from our ancestors is as detailed as the information we gain from actually experiencing and learning things.

So, my shower thought was that maybe we are using way too much data to train the models. Clearly, there is enough information in much less data to gain a deep understanding of the world.

I do recognize that it's the trillion dollar question to construct a model that would need less data to develop as good of a world model as gpt4 or the other sota models.

Instrumental Variable validity,1bqxqru,"I have a big graph and I used DoWhy to do inference with instrumental variables. I wanted to confirm that the instrumental variables were valid. To my knowledge give the graph below:  
1- IV should be independent of u (low correlation)  
2- IV and outcome should be dependent (high correlation)  
3- IV and outcome should be independent given TREAT (low partial correlation)

  
To verify those assumptions I calculated correlations and partial correlations. Surprisingly IV and OUTCOME are strongly correlated (partial correlation using TREAT as covariate). I did some reading and I noticed that assumption 3 is mentioned but often not tested. Assuming my DGP is correct, how would you deal with assumption 3 when validating IVs with graph and data ( I copied the code at the bottom) .

Supervised learning classification model VS anomaly detection model. Has anyone done both and compared results? ,1bqrgm5,"I was given a small sample of data and tasked with creating a classification model, where the classes were essentially “normal” and multiple versions of “anomaly”. My XGBoost classification model did very well, where I did an 80/20 train/test split with 3-fold cross validation. Realizing that there could be more versions of “anomaly” than what I was given, I decided to make an anomaly detection model, training on only the “normal” observations in the training data set and testing on the entire test data set. 

To my surprise, both my one class support vector machine and my autoencoder results were abysmal. I suspect my issue stems from a low sample size and a high number of features. That’s not the focus of this post though.

Could you guys provide some suggestions on ways to inspect the model I'm working on?,1bqfzzx,"My employer has me working on updating and refining a model of rents that my predecessor made. The model is simple OLS for interpretability (which is fine by me) and I've been mostly incorporating exogenous data that I've scratched together. The original model used primarily data related to the homes in our portfolio. My general theory is that people choose to live in certain places for more reasons than the home itself. So including data that describe the neighborhood (math scores at the closest schools for example) should add needed context.

According to standard metrics, it's been going gangbusters. I'm not nearly out of ideas on data to draw in and I've gone from an R-Squared of .86 to .91, AIC has decreased by 3.8% and when inspecting visually where there was previously a nasty curve at the low and high ends of the loess on the actual values versus predicted scatterplot, it's now straightened out. Tests for multicollinearity all check out. *However*, my next step is pretty work intensive and when talking to my boss he mentioned it would be a good time to take a deeper dive in inspecting the model. He said the last time they tried to update it they did alright with the typical metrics but that specific communities and regions (it's a large national portfolio) suffered in accuracy and bias and that's why they didn't update it.

I just started this job a month ago and I'm trying to come out of the gate strong. I've got some ideas, but I was hoping you guys could hit me with some innovative ways to do a deeper dive inspecting the model. Plots are good, interactive plots are better.

Thinking of dipping out of DS for an MBA. Legit looking for advice.,1bpnem1,"Edit: Heads up! I did post recently but I want to know your thoughts on making this switch.

Ok so I’m in my late 30s and I feel I’ve hit a wall. I work for a tech company as an IC and I make a decent salary, just over 200k a year, but I look up and I only see roadblocks ahead of me. Before going back to school to get my MS I had  a BS in CS but was serving as an officer in the Army leading division level staff. I loved my time in the army but wanted to progress, hence the transition. 

Data science has been super interesting but progression seems so difficult to come by and you make no strategy decisions for your organization, at least in my case. 

I’m thinking of backing up and going down another path. That said I also have financial obligations including a mortgage and I’m fresh out of GI Bill. 

Is this worth the opportunity cost if I go to a good school? Is it worth it at all? Is there another path to take that would make more sense?

"Best Supplementary Texts for Casella and Berger are ""Introduction to Probability"" (first half) and ""The Simple and Infinite Joy of Mathematical Statistics"" (second half)",1bpjsas,"Making this post to help current and future grad students. I'd also to help departments choose good supplementary books for non-pure statistics programs, like biostatistics, economics, psychometrics, etc.  I'm working through the tail end of a first year graduate mathematical statistics sequence. I only had an intro probability course using ""Mathematical Statistics with Applications"" by Wackerly beyond the typical math courses in engineering BS programs. Neither is as rigorous as ""Statistical Inference"", but they're close. I've found ""Statistical Inference"" clearer as a second read.

My two suggestions are ""Introduction to Probability"" by Blitzstein and Hwang for the first half. The STAT 110 lectures are on YouTube. The book is very conversational in tone.

""The Simple and Infinite Joy of Mathematical Statistics""  by JN Corcoran is amazing for the statistical inference half  for many of the same reasons as ""Introduction to Probability"". It's expensive, but I think its privately published. My paperback from Amazon came with a stamp saying it was made two days prior. Her writing style is incredible and she genuinely makes the reader excited to learn. She also had a playlist on YouTube for CU Boulder.

For fun, I fitted a OLS model (y \~ W1 + W2 + v0 + Z1 + Z2) on the data and, surprisingly the beta for the treatment v0 is 10. I was expecting something different from 10, because of the confounders.

what does LLM data prep look like for you?,1bosue5,"Hey all,

I'm working on an open source dev tool that makes it incredibly simple to scale your python code across thousands of computers in the cloud.

Over the next few days I'm going to be releasing the source code on GH and I want to make sure I have some useful tutorials to accompany it.

I have a few tutorials that I think will be highly valuable but I'd love to hear some suggestions from the community. What data prep problems do you always find yourself solving for? Do you need to do it across a large amount of data? 

Here is the current list

* Batch inference using Mistral 7B across 250 GPUs
* Tokenizing millions rows of training data
* Compressing millions of tokens
* Mapping compressed tokens back to text

Something to keep in mind is that the tool is specifically built for embarrassingly parallel workloads. LLM training is not a great use case because it requires inter-node communication while adjusting model weights.

How best to model drop-off rates?,1bo8fqe,"I’m working on a project at the moment and would like to hear you guys’ thoughts. 

I have data on the number of people who stopped watching a tv show episode broken down by minute for the duration of the episode. 
I have data on the genre of the show along with some topics extracted from the script by minute.

I would like to evaluate whether there is a connection between certain topics, perhaps interacting with genre, that cause an incremental amount of people to ‘drop off’.

I’m wondering how best to model this data? 

1) The drop off rate is fastest in the first 2-3 minutes of every episode, regardless of script, and so I’m thinking I should normalise in some way across the episodes timelines or perhaps use the time in minutes as a feature in the model?

2) I’m also considering modelling the second differential as opposed to the drop off at a particular minute as this might tell a better story in terms of the cause of the drop off. 

3) Given (1) and (2) what would be your suggestions in terms of models?

Would a CHAID/Random Forest work in this scenario? Hoping it would be able to capture collections of topics that could be associated with an increased or decreased second differential.

Data Science Salary vs GDP per Capita,1bo0qx0,"Naturally, GDP per capita has a strong correlation with the salary of any profession, including Data Scientists. It is interesting to see, however, which countries pay more than expected based on GDP. The United States not only pays the highest, but it seems to pay way more than the GDP would predict. My interpretation is that this is due to the many successful global companies in the US, which means that a single hour of DS work scales across many more users comparatively to average companies in other countries.

The basis for this chart are the predictions from the data science salary prediction model, performed only once for a given set of job's features (across all possible combinations of the job's features), to avoid the common mistake of just taking the average salary in the dataset for the analysis.

Over the last decade, I've participated in a dozen data science projects in industry. When projects hit production, it's critical to have unit and integration tests to prevent pushing faulty features or models. I've [summarized my learnings in a blog post](https://ploomber.io/blog/ci-for-ds/), here's the summary:

&#x200B;

1. Structure your pipeline in several tasks, each one saving intermediate results to disk
2. Implement your pipeline in such a way that you can parametrize it
3. The first parameter should sample raw data to allow quick end-to-end runs for testing
4. A second parameter should change artifacts location to separate testing and production environments
5. On every push, the CI service runs unit tests that verify logic inside each task
6. The pipeline is then executed with a data sample and integration tests verify integrity of intermediate results",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bnvj8w/continuous_integration_for_data_science/,databot_,28,Education,8,New
Why did you get into data science? ,1bnqytr,"I’m currently a sr. Data analyst, love my job and I’ve come to appreciate the power of analytics in a business setting . When I first went to school I spent time as a data scientist which was equally as enjoyable for different reasons. 

What I’ve seen in the real world is data science has difficulty in generating business value and can be disconnected from business drivers. While I don’t disagree that work done by data science can be critical for some companies, I’ve seen many companies get more value from analytics and experimentation. 

There has been some discussion that the natural progression in the field is to go from data analyst to data scientist, but why? In companies I’ve worked for DS and DA were paid on the same technical level while usually working more hours( this goes for DE as well), so the move can’t be for the $. 

For those in data science, why did you chose that route vs analytics. For those that transitioned from DA to DS, did you feel like you made the right choice? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bnqytr/why_did_you_get_into_data_science/,anonymous_da,127,Career Discussion,103,New
Got rejected from Analytics engineering role because of having marketing experience (which I don’t have),1bnqgvy,"I’m an Analytics Engineer / Sr. Data Analyst with one of the big tech companies from Australia, although working remotely from Canada. I was applying for a Staff Analytics Engineer role, had the recruiter interview, had the interview with the hiring manager. Everything went well, he said that I’ll be getting the take home technical assessment by the end of the week. I kept waiting and got nothing, after  one and half weeks got a rejection email. 

I reached out to the recruiter to get the feedback and she said that the hiring manager says I have marketing experience and they want someone with data experience. I was like I literally don’t have any marketing experience. I’ve been working as a data analyst, then sr data analyst and now analytics engineer. For background I’ve 6.5 years of experience in data space, and no where in my resume did I mention anything about marketing nor did I say anything in the interview which would have caused this confusion.

Name & Shame: Carlyle Group Investment Data Science,1bnmif0,"I think we're due for a name & shame! Sharing my experience in case it's helpful for future applicants.

# Company & Role

The Carlyle Group is a Private Equity mega-fund. They essentially buy and flip companies like a real estate investor buys and flips houses. They've recently (in the past few years) spun up a data science org. My understanding is that the responsibilities of this role would entail assisting the deal team in commercial due diligences of prospective investments, assisting in portfolio operations and consulting on advanced analytics for the portfolio companies, as well as company wide data science initiatives. My impression was that this role would not be very involved in deal sourcing.

# My Background

* FAANG Senior DS
* Worked in management consulting in the past - primarily as a data science consultant for Silicon Valley tech companies but also did a commercial due diligence project with our M&A practice as a DS consultant
* Ivy League masters in CS / Top 20 undergrad

# Application Process & Experience

* I first cold applied online
* After a short period of time I received an email from a Carlyle recruiter with a link to a 2 hour Hackerrank exam. I did not first receive any introductory call or even an introductory email - just an email with a URL to Hackerrank.
* I decided to take the exam. It consisted of:
   * One SQL (medium / window functions)
   * One Python (leetcode easy)
   * Discrete probability (e.g. probability of making a full house if you randomly draw 5 cards from a standard deck)
   * Domain specific data science questions (e.g. how would you apply data science to this private equity problem)
   * Overall I felt comfortable with all aspects of the exam and felt that it was well within my wheelhouse
* After completing the exam I sent a note to the recruiter. They scheduled a call with the ""senior recruiter"" for end of week
* The call with senior recruiter was fairly standard and covered the nature of the team, responsibilities of the role, and my background. I thought the call went well and was under the impression that I'd be moving forward in the process  (though I've learned never to take what recruiters say at face value)
* At the end of the call the senior recruiter asked if I had taken the Hackerrank exam yet. I was a bit surprised that they did not already know the answer to that question.
* After exactly one week of radio silence since the initial call, I emailed the first recruiter to let them know that I had seen some progress in my other searches (true) and asked if my application was still in consideration. I did not receive a response to this email.
* I waited one more week (two weeks since the initial call and about three weeks since I took the exam) and emailed the senior recruiter for a status update. I didn't receive a response to this email either but will edit this post if they ever do respond.

# Conclusion

* At this point I've concluded that I've been ghosted. I can only speculate as to why. I'm leaning towards them just being highly disorganized.
* For future applicants I strongly, strongly advise not taking their HackerRank exam unless you don't mind having your time wasted. I'm willing to bet nobody at Carlyle even looked at my test responses.

\*\*EDIT\*\*

It seems a lot of you think that ghosting is professionally acceptable. If you're investing your time, the bare minimum is a courtesy email to let you know you won't be moving forward in the process. That's actually table stakes.

Do you also wrap your data processing functions in classes?,1bmoyzu,"I work in a team of data scientists on time series forecasting pipelines, and I have the feeling that my colleagues overuse OOP paradigms. Let us say we have two dataframes, and we have a set of functions which calculates some deltas between them:

    def calculate_delta(df1: pd.DataFrame, df2: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        delta = # some calculations incl. more functions
        return delta
    
    delta = calculate_delta(df1, df2)

What my coleagues usually do with this, that they wrap this function in a class, something like:

    class DeltaCalculatorProcessor:
        def __init__(self, df1: pd.DataFrame, df2: pd.DataFrame):
            self.__df1 = df1
            self.__df2 = df2
            self.__delta = pd.DataFrame()
    
        def calculate_delta(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
            ... # update self.__delta calculated from self.__df1 and self.__df2 using more class methods
            return self.__delta

And then they call it with

    dcp = DeltaCalculatorProcessor(df1, df2)
    delta = dcp.calculate_delta()

They always do this, even if they don't use this class more than once, so practically they just add yet another abstraction layer on the top of a set of functions, saying that ""this is how professional software developers do"", ""this is industrial best practice"" etc.

Do you also do this in your team? Maybe I have PTSD from having been a Java programmer before for ages, but I find the excessive use of classes for code structuring actually harder to maintain than just simply organizing the codes with functions, especially for data pipelines (where the input is a set of dataframes and the output is also a set of dataframes).

P.S. I wanted to keep my example short, so I haven't shown more smaller functions inside calculate_delta(). But the emphasis is not that they would wrap 1 single function in a class; but that they wrap a set of functions in a class without any further reasons (the wrapper class is not re-used, there is no internal state to maintain etc.). So the full app could be organized with pure functions, they just wrap the functions in ""Processor"" and ""Orchestrator"" classes, using one time classes for code organization.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bmoyzu/do_you_also_wrap_your_data_processing_functions/,Asleep-Dress-3578,197,Coding,95,New

Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak,1bln0ix,"Use the Display API to replace complex Matplotlib code 

[ Scikit-learn Visualization Guide: Making Models Speak. ](https://preview.redd.it/pimy1i38a1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31492e48a5d39171c60d8e96ee8698c670327e7)

# Introduction

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 A good chart can show us what a model is doing in an easy-to-understand way. Here's an example: 

[ Decision boundaries of two different generalization performances. ](https://preview.redd.it/3rrwu8rfa1qc1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=9425bbe57deb98a854a40fdc0979149637078047)

 This graph makes it clear that for the same dataset, the model on the right is better at generalizing. 

 Most machine learning books prefer to use raw Matplotlib code for visualization, which leads to issues: 

1. You have to learn a lot about drawing with Matplotlib.
2. Plotting code fills up your notebook, making it hard to read.
3. Sometimes you need third-party libraries, which isn't ideal in business settings.

 Good news! Scikit-learn now offers Display classes that let us use methods like from\_estimator and from\_predictions to make drawing graphs for different situations much easier. 

 Curious? Let me show you these cool APIs. 

 

# Scikit-learn Display API Introduction

### Use utils.discovery.all_displays to find available APIs

 Scikit-learn (sklearn) always adds Display APIs in new releases, so it's key to know what's available in your version. 

 Sklearn's [utils.discovery.all\_displays](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays) lets you see which classes you can use. 

    from sklearn.utils.discovery import all_displays
    
    displays = all_displays()
    displays

 For example, in my Scikit-learn 1.4.0, these classes are available: 

    [('CalibrationDisplay', sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay),
     ('ConfusionMatrixDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.confusion_matrix.ConfusionMatrixDisplay),
     ('DecisionBoundaryDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.decision_boundary.DecisionBoundaryDisplay),
     ('DetCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.det_curve.DetCurveDisplay),
     ('LearningCurveDisplay', sklearn.model_selection._plot.LearningCurveDisplay),
     ('PartialDependenceDisplay',
      sklearn.inspection._plot.partial_dependence.PartialDependenceDisplay),
     ('PrecisionRecallDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.precision_recall_curve.PrecisionRecallDisplay),
     ('PredictionErrorDisplay',
      sklearn.metrics._plot.regression.PredictionErrorDisplay),
     ('RocCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.roc_curve.RocCurveDisplay),
     ('ValidationCurveDisplay',
      sklearn.model_selection._plot.ValidationCurveDisplay)]

### Using inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay for decision boundaries

 Since we mentioned it, let's start with decision boundaries. 

 If you use Matplotlib to draw them, it's a hassle: 

* Use np.linspace to set coordinate ranges;
* Use plt.meshgrid to calculate the grid;
* Use plt.contourf to draw the decision boundary fill;
* Then use plt.scatter to plot data points.

 Now, with  [inspection.DecisionBoundaryDispla](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-inspection-decisionboundarydisplay), you can simplify this process: 

    from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
    X = iris.data[['petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']]
    y = iris.target
    
    
    svc_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                            SVC(kernel='linear', C=1))
    svc_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    display = DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(svc_clf, X, 
                                                     grid_resolution=1000,
                                                     xlabel=""Petal length (cm)"",
                                                     ylabel=""Petal width (cm)"")
    plt.scatter(X.iloc[:, 0], X.iloc[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='w')
    plt.title(""Decision Boundary"")
    plt.show()

 See the final effect in the figure: 

[ Use DecisionBoundaryDisplay to draw a triple classification model. ](https://preview.redd.it/501h2r27b1qc1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3614719f48e74c6aabd0d0754c6b08b80f87d02)

 Remember, Display can only draw 2D, so make sure your data has only two features or reduced dimensions. 

### Using calibration.CalibrationDisplay for probability calibration

 To compare classification models, probability calibration curves show how confident models are in their predictions. 

 Note that  [CalibrationDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay) uses the model's  predict\_proba. If you use a support vector machine, set probability to True: 

    from sklearn.calibration import CalibrationDisplay
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000,
                               n_classes=2, n_features=5,
                               random_state=42)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    proba_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), 
                              SVC(kernel=""rbf"", gamma=""auto"", 
                                  C=10, probability=True))
    proba_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(proba_clf, 
                                                X_test, y_test)
    
    hist_clf = HistGradientBoostingClassifier()
    hist_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    ax = plt.gca()
    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(hist_clf,
                                      X_test, y_test,
                                      ax=ax)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn by CalibrationDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/ovcp8hcgb1qc1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=93515b81145abbb70424dcc69bf0cf8569ac4e3a)

### Using metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay for confusion matrices

 When assessing classification models and dealing with imbalanced data, we look at precision and recall. 

 These break down into TP, FP, TN, and FN – a confusion matrix. 

 To draw one, use  [metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-confusionmatrixdisplay). It's well-known, so I'll skip the details. 

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
    
    digits = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)
    X, y = digits.data, digits.target
    rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    rf_clf.fit(X, y)
    
    ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(rf_clf, X, y)
    plt.show()

[ Charts drawn with ConfusionMatrixDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/tfbcdin8f1qc1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1eaaf8e085e1cff8bb9c4bd971dade508010390)

### metrics.RocCurveDisplay and metrics.DetCurveDisplay

 These two are together because they're often used to evaluate side by side. 

 [RocCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay) compares TPR and FPR for the model. 

 For binary classification, you want low FPR and high TPR, so the upper left corner is best. The Roc curve bends towards this corner. 

 Because the Roc curve stays near the upper left, leaving the lower right empty, it's hard to see model differences. 

 So, we also use [DetCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay) to draw a Det curve with FNR and FPR. It uses more space, making it clearer than the Roc curve. 

 The perfect point for a Det curve is the lower left corner. 

    from sklearn.metrics import RocCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.metrics import DetCurveDisplay
    
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10_000, n_features=5,
                               n_classes=2, n_informative=2)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42,
                                                        stratify=y)
    
    
    classifiers = {
        ""SVC"": make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC(kernel=""linear"", C=0.1, random_state=42)),
        ""Random Forest"": RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
    }
    
    fig, [ax_roc, ax_det] = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    for name, clf in classifiers.items():
        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_roc, name=name)
        DetCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_det, name=name)

[ Comparison Chart of RocCurveDisplay and DetCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/odavl54yh1qc1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=6408e319b099ce12c3eff70e788ed0224558e099)

### Using metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay to adjust thresholds

 With imbalanced data, you might want to shift recall and precision. 

* For email fraud, you want high precision.
* For disease screening, you want high recall to catch more cases.

 You can adjust the threshold, but what's the right amount? 

 Here, [metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-precisionrecalldisplay) can help. 

    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
    from sklearn.metrics import PrecisionRecallDisplay
    
    wine = load_wine()
    X, y = wine.data[wine.target<=1], wine.target[wine.target<=1]
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
                                                        stratify=y, random_state=42)
    
    xgb_clf = XGBClassifier()
    xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_estimator(xgb_clf, X_test, y_test)
    plt.show()

[ Charting xgboost model evaluation using PrecisionRecallDisplay.  ](https://preview.redd.it/8giy5tr8i1qc1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b96373c182f515a655d6f4029f44982c87b05d)

 This shows that models following Scikit-learn's design can be drawn, like xgboost here. Handy, right? 

### Using metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay for regression models

 We've talked about classification, now let's talk about regression. 

 Scikit-learn's [metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-predictionerrordisplay) helps assess regression models. 

    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    from sklearn.metrics import PredictionErrorDisplay
    
    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
    X = rng.random(size=(200, 2)) * 10
    y = X[:, 0]**2 + 5 * X[:, 1] + 10 + rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.1, size=(200,))
    
    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='linear', C=10))
    reg.fit(X, y)
    
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[0], kind=""actual_vs_predicted"")
    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[1], kind=""residual_vs_predicted"")
    plt.show()

[Two charts were drawn by PredictionErrorDisplay.](https://preview.redd.it/9uxuobuti1qc1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db276b2a7d637cf53887e4cebe87b9a23593b9b)

 As shown, it can draw two kinds of graphs. The left shows predicted vs. actual values – good for linear regression. 

 However, not all data is perfectly linear. For that, use the right graph. 

 It compares real vs. predicted differences, a residuals plot. 

 This plot's banana shape suggests our data might not fit linear regression. 

 Switching from a linear to an rbf kernel can help. 

    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='rbf', C=10))

[ A visual demonstration of the improved model performance.  ](https://preview.redd.it/fsu1yqg0j1qc1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=860447d0c8a1c0c38539f5fac16998ed928c8714)

 See, with rbf, the residual plot looks better. 

### Using model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay for learning curves

 After assessing performance, let's look at optimization with [LearningCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay).

  First up, learning curves – how well the model generalizes with different training and testing data, and if it suffers from variance or bias. 

 As shown below, we compare a DecisionTreeClassifier and a GradientBoostingClassifier to see how they do as training data changes. 

    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

 The graph shows that although the tree-based GradientBoostingClassifier maintains good accuracy on the training data, its generalization capability on test data does not have a significant advantage over the DecisionTreeClassifier. 

### Using model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay for visualizing parameter tuning

 So, for models that don't generalize well, you might try adjusting the model's regularization parameters to tweak its performance. 

 The traditional approach is to use tools like GridSearchCV or Optuna to tune the model, but these methods only give you the overall best-performing model and the tuning process is not very intuitive. 

 For scenarios where you want to adjust a specific parameter to test its effect on the model, I recommend using [model\_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay) to visualize how the model performs as the parameter changes. 

    from sklearn.model_selection import ValidationCurveDisplay
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    
    param_name, param_range = ""C"", np.logspace(-8, 3, 10)
    lr_clf = LogisticRegression()
    
    ValidationCurveDisplay.from_estimator(lr_clf, X, y,
                                          param_name=param_name,
                                          param_range=param_range,
                                          scoring='f1_weighted',
                                          cv=5, n_jobs=-1)

# Some regrets

 After trying out all these Displays, I must admit some regrets: 

 

* The biggest one is that most of these APIs lack detailed tutorials, which is probably why they're not well-known compared to Scikit-learn's thorough documentation.
* These APIs are scattered across various packages, making it hard to reference them from a single place.
* The code is still pretty basic. You often need to pair it with Matplotlib's APIs to get the job done. A typical example is DecisionBoundaryDisplay  
, where after plotting the decision boundary, you still need Matplotlib to plot the data distribution.
* They're hard to extend. Besides a few methods validating parameters, it's tough to simplify my model visualization process with tools or methods; I end up rewriting a lot.

 I hope these APIs get more attention, and as versions upgrade, visualization APIs become even easier to use. 

 

# Conclusion

 In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. 

 This article introduced various plotting APIs in the current version of scikit-learn. 

 With these APIs, you can simplify some Matplotlib code, ease your learning curve, and streamline your model evaluation process. 

 Due to length, I didn't expand on each API. If interested, you can check the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/visualizations.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) for more details. 

 Now it's your turn. What are your expectations for visualizing machine learning methods? Feel free to leave a comment and discuss.

Requesting advice for an intern,1bljc6v,"I am currently working as a Data Science intern at an MNC. However, I am facing a dilemma regarding whether to continue at my present company or move to another one.

On the positive side:

1. We are given unrestricted access to real company data to do our projects.
2. The workplace environment is very nice and provides us with a lot of flexibility and independence. We can choose our own projects, never have to work overtime and work mode is hybrid, even for senior employees. Everyone in the team is technically sound and given equal opportunities and responsibilities.
3. Our (original) manager is great, very experienced and genuinely teaches us a lot of valuable things, including life skills.
4. We are taught everything from data analysis to software engineering, project management and presenting to non-technical audiences, which are increasingly necessary skills.
5. The projects we work on are fantastic. We do everything from coming up with project ideas and giving proposals for those ideas and getting them approved, to making dashboards for storytelling of our findings and deploying them on a private company channel.
6. We are encouraged to understand the business process and supply chain as well as how our work affects the company's financial metrics instead of blindly saying on our resume that we contributed x% to y metric. We are allowed to participate in professional meetings and even contribute in them!

However, there are some negative aspects:

1. Often, it feels like we aren't doing data science at all. For many projects, instead of building our own models, we simply make an API call to a pre-trained HuggingFace model or similar. It sometimes feels like we are doing a software engineering internship rather than a data science internship.
2. Our manager recently got promoted and hired our senior intern to become our new manager. Our new manager was confused and made frequent mistakes in management. It was a weird experience to go from someone extremely experienced to someone extremely inexperienced, though he has improved in the last few days.
3. Me and another intern were given the task of interviewing new internship candidates, of course under the supervision of our original manager. This was a good experience, but our manager told us to ""try"" hiring female interns for the sake of ""diversity"". As a result, two extremely good male candidates were rejected and one barely decent female intern was hired (along with a genuinely good female candidate).
4. Our new manager and the aforementioned female candidate have a lot of office politics going on. He has abysmal joking skills, saying inappropriate jokes like ""Why was this fellow hired? He should be fired!"" and she is very sensitive, taking offense very easily, leading to a very tense atmosphere at the office.

So, I would like to ask my seniors - should I continue here or apply to another company? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bljc6v/requesting_advice_for_an_intern/,Economy_Feeling_3661,12,Career Discussion,20,New

"Learning Python and R at the same time - Pros and Cons, and Do's and Don'ts",1bjndue,"EDIT: Thank you for all the amazing insights so far!

Hi all,

The question is for those who have experience with this. I like to have one as a main language and the other as the sidekick. For now I seem to have chosen for Python for several reasons, more courses and tutorials, more articles, larger community. However, R and by extension RStudio/Posit, somehow has a huge attraction to me. Maybe it's their lively Youtube channel, great looking website, ... they just seem to be out there.

I installed both, tried both, chose Python as my main focus. At least once a week RStudio is calling me so I launch it and click around (I like Quarto too btw). But the more I learn Python, the more I find R code to be weird.

In the end I just need to try learning both to find out if it's going to work out, but I like to ask the community first so I can start from a sort of baseline on those with experience in learning them at the same time.

What are the pros and cons, do's and don'ts? Did you basically do everything twice, once in Py and once in R? Or use them for different things, perhaps EDA in R, but then move to Py for ML (or vice versa)? Would that be a good way to learn both, or even make it more complicated?

A bit of background info, I'm learning this in my spare time, neither is used at my current job. Looking at job descriptions on my side of the world, the most asked of the two is Python, some ask for R, some ask for R as a second, and a few stated that either is fine. To me learning a second has merit and potential purpose.

Anyone work in car insurance? Question about risk models,1bjd62i,"The New York Times recently released a few stories \[1,2,3\] that shows that newer, internet-enabled cars are selling driving data (trip times, number of 'hard brakes', number of 'hard acceleration', average speed, etc) to data brokers like LexisNexis, who then generate a driver risk score that is sold to insurance companies.  These got me wondering about a couple of statistical things about the driving data that's collected via these apps. 

Setting aside the ethics of not disclosing this kind of data collection (which is creepy), I was wondering whether the driving data actually helps model risk better. I could imagine two arguments: 

1- Driving behavior data helps because someone who is hard braking all the time is more likely to get into an accident. So knowing that someone hard brakes 3-4 times more than the average driver is a good predictor of risk. 

2- The additional data isn't actually useful because truly bad drivers get tickets and accidents, and hence the additional data from driving records don't add that much predictive signal above and beyond prior tickets and accidents. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone here work in these industries and have an informed take? It matters because my opinion about whether this kind of data collection should be legal or not really depends on the utility of it. Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the US and I have zero sympathy for people who drive in a manner that endangers other people. But if the additional signals from this data really don't do that much to better price risk, it's not clear that the privacy concerns are worth it.

A data scientist got caught lying about their project work and past experience during interview today,1bj9cvc,"I was part of an interview panel for a staff data science role. The candidate had written a really impressive resume with lots of domain specific project work experience about creating and deploying cutting-edge ML products. They had even mentioned the ROI in millions of dollars. The candidate started talking endlessly about the ML models they had built, the cloud platforms they'd used to deploy, etc. But then, when other panelists dug in, the candidate could not answer some domain specific questions they had claimed extensive experience for. So it was just like any other interview.

One panelist wasn't convinced by the resume though. Turns out this panelist had been a consultant at the company where the candidate had worked previously, and had many acquaintances from there on LinkedIn as well. She texted one of them asking if the claims the candidate was making were true. According to this acquaintance, the candidate was not even part of the projects they'd mentioned on the resume, and the ROI numbers were all made up. Turns out the project team had once given a demo to the candidate's team on how to use their ML product.

When the panelist shared this information with others on the panel, the candidate was rejected and a feedback was sent to the HR saying the candidate had faked their work experience.

This isn't the first time I've come across people ""plagiarizing"" (for the lack of a better word) others' project works as their's during interview and in resumes. But this incident was wild. But do you think a deserving and more eligible candidate misses an opportunity everytime a fake resume lands at your desk? Should HR do a better job filtering resumes?

Edit 1: Some have asked if she knew the whole company. Obviously not, even though its not a big company. But the person she connected with knew about the project the candidate had mentioned in the resume. All she asked was whether the candidate was related to the project or not. Also, the candidate had already resigned from the company, signed NOC for background checks, and was a immediate joiner, which is one of the reasons why they were shortlisted by the HR. 

Edit 2: My field of work requires good amount of domain knowledge, at least at the Staff/Senior role, who're supposed to lead a team. It's still a gamble nevertheless, irrespective of who is hired, and most hiring managers know it pretty well. They just like to derisk as much as they can so that the team does not suffer. As I said the candidate's interview was just like any other interview except for the fact that they got caught.

Career Movement After Hitting Manager,1bi3u1k,"Hi all,

I’m looking for people’s advice on making potentially a downward move in my DS career. Basically, I work for a company with a relatively small DS department in a relatively low-paying business sector. Because I got in on the team early, and I have good people skills, I got promoted to a manager position about a year and a half ago. The company is good to work for, and I don’t mind management work, but the pay gap that comes with the industry has been feeling like more of an opportunity cost the longer I stay there, so I’ve started to look at other positions.

I’m guessing it would be hard to manage a team in another industry without the requisite domain experience, so my question is this: would it be seen as a negative on my resume if I ended up having to take a “lower-level” DS job to get experience in that industry, or is that more common than I think? I’m less concerned about a pay decrease since I’m pretty sure it will be an increase either way, but I’m thinking of how it might look on a resume.

Am I cheating myself?,1bi0sxx,"Currently a data science undergrad doing lots of machine learning projects with Chatgpt. I understand how these models work but I make chatgpt type out most the code to save time. I can usually debug on my own and adjust parameters by myself but without chatgpt I haven't memorized sklearn or seaborn libraries enough on my own to lets say create a random forest model on my own. Am I cheating myself? Should i type out every line of code or keep saving time with Chatgpt? For those of you in the industry, how often do you look stuff up? Can you do most model building and data analysis on our own with no outside help or stackoverflow?

How to approach this problem? ,1bi0fum,"Let's say I have a dataset of 1000 records. Combinations of these records belong to groups (each group has its own id) e.g. Records 1 and 10 might form a group, records 390 and 777 might form a group. A group can also consist of (many) more than two record. A record can only ever belong to one single group. 

I have labeled historical data that tells me which items belong to which groups. The data features are a mix of categorical, boolean, numeric and string (100+ columns). I am tasked with creating a model that predicts which items belong together. In addition, I need to extract rulesets that should be understandable by humans. 

Every day I will get a new set of 1000 records where I need to predict which records are likely to belong together. How do I even begin to approach this? I'm not really predicting the group, but rather which items go together. Is this classification? Clustering? I'm not looking for a full solution but some guidance on the type of problem this is and how it might be approached. 

Note : the above numbers are examples, I'm likely to get millions of records each day. Some of the pairinsg will be obvious (e.g. Amounts are the exact same) but there are likely to be many non-obvious rules based on combinations of features.

I am now using auc-pr, and getting very low results 0.4 and below.

My question arises from seeing imbalanced classification tasks -  from kaggle and research papers - all using roc\_auc, and calling it a day.

So, in your projects when did you call a classifier successful and what did you use to decide that, how many false positives were acceptable?

An embarassment of riches in terms of server processor--but why?,1bhl2d7,"I'm not a data science major but I work in a private company's server room and I thought this might be as good a place to ask this question as any: Why are big chip companies launching processors that seem likely to cannibalize their own market shares?

This question came into my head when I was reading press announcements from a server company we buy from. I'm gonna use their products to illustrate my question but it's for convenience's sake, said company is just more actively promoting these new servers so they caught my eye.

So obviously Nvidia's H100 accelerators are being touted as one of the fastest for AI development. They even have a module that combines eight of these babies, it's called HGX H100 8-GPU, you can see it in this server from the brand I talked about, Gigabyte: [G593-SD1](https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G593-SD1-rev-AAX1?lan=en).

But then Nvidia also has the famous ""Grace Hopper"" superchip, which is also available from Gigabyte ([H263-V11](https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/High-Density-Server/H263-V11-rev-LAW1?lan=en)) but which seems to compete against its own H100 accelerators.

But wait, they're not the only one to do this! AMD has MI300X accelerators (as seen on the [G593-ZX1](https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G593-ZX1-rev-AAX1?lan=en)), but in *the same series* they have the MI300A APU (as seen on the [G383-R80](https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G383-R80-rev-AAM1?lan=en)), which is a CPU+GPU package lik the Grace Hopper, and also seems to be competing against its own sibling.

My company is not quite up to training our own AI models yet but I want to be prepared in case I ever get asked to help make a choice. Dunno if you guys might have insight into my question?

"How to Handle ""Have Their Cake and Eat It Too"" Stakeholders",1bhcolw,"Some stakeholder teams I work with approach our collaboration with a ""Have Their Cake and Eat It Too"". Where they will request robust analyses, looking at many different domain related metrics, but expect layman interpretable (their stakeholders) decks/deliverables. A specific example:

A team of mostly clinicians wanted to look at around 20 metrics to assess the efficacy of one of their intervention programs. Some of these metrics are extremely domain specific and in some ways very opaque to those with little background on the subject. I conducted my analyses and created a deck highlighting the methodology I used and the topline outcomes. We used that deck to go through and discuss each and every outcome. Subsequently, I get asked to ""reinterpret"" the deck for a layman audience and ""use plain language"" to describe most of those 20 outcomes. 

Often times these comments come during the PowerPoint like, ""Great, I am glad we can see X effect/outcome due to this methodology, but I cant interpret X for my stakeholder due to this methodology. Can we add slides to describe the impact of this."" It can be frustrating because it feels as if they are trying to jam-in several project stages into my stage of the project. 

Our data team realistically has limited time and resources and already has to ""say no"" to a lot of proposals and ideas. How can I temper expectations for these projects? I know I can give longer SLA estimates and explain why it is extended but I'm not sure how that will help with unrealistic expectations. My own opinion is that these teams are unloading some of what is their responsibility (using the data they request to make decisions and applying their own domain expertise) on us.

Any other experiences with this? Any frameworks that can be used to either force realistic expectations or maybe to better move from granular analyses -> least common denominator outcomes.

I’m really getting frustrated with my career trajectory.,1bhav92,"I’m hoping to get some career advice. I was a special operator in the military on active duty, the kind you go through selection for, and did intelligence work when I was much younger.  I then transitioned to officer where I was managing a couple of large intelligence cells at up to division level. When I got out and was pursuing a masters I managed two very large restaurants as a general manager. After graduating I became a data scientist where I applied my work toward national security problems as a contractor. As an individual contributor I often worked with some high level military leaders. 

I left to go work at a tech company as an individual contributor because i wanted the credentials of having worked in tech and the money was good. I expected to rapidly grow here into leadership but I feel my role is stagnant and I’m not growing as a leader nor do I feel the opportunities are going to present themselves. I want to be in a role where I can help by making leadership decisions for an organization and managing teams but I feel stuck. I fully expected data science to help me in my leadership ambitions because you understand the technical aspects far better but it hasn’t been in the cards. The money here is good but I don’t enjoy not being a decision maker. 

Not that I don’t think PMs are valuable but it frustrates me when I end up with someone with very little practical experience sitting over me as a PM. 

I dunno maybe I’m just being jealous because I took this path over a PM path.

Anyway, I don’t know. Should I unwind and back up and try a different trajectory? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bhav92/im_really_getting_frustrated_with_my_career/,sonictoddler,101,Career Discussion,73,New

Tips for communicating with non-technical stakeholders,1bfge3g,"I think it’s fair to say that one of the key aspects of a lot (most) DA/DS roles is the ability to communicating results and technical ideas with non-technical stakeholders. 

I’m really interested to know what everybody here thinks that actually means in practice.

To me, it means:

* When presenting (e.g. slides), using concise key points, and graphs/charts that aren’t overwhelming, keep different colours to a minimum etc.

* Using language which adds more “relatability”. So rather than saying e.g. “17% of people”, saying “around 1 in 6 people”

* When talking about “raw data”, I like to be very clear about what each row represents in the context of what I’m looking at. Related to this - when you’ve aggregated or processed data, show an example of the raw data prior to aggregating to demonstrate exactly what you’ve done, to add context.

* Don’t say “we fit a linear regression model to the data by solving for the coefficients which minimise sum of the squared residuals” - instead, put it in plain English,  say “this is a mathematical model which predicts the value of Y based on X. We have used the data to determine the slope and intercept of a line which best fits the data”

How correct/close are trendwatchers and research institutes about their DS/AI forecasts?,1bfbwu4,"Hi all,

Based on your own experience and observations, how close are their forecasts on DS/AI in terms of technological development, market/business adoption, and workforce supply and demand?

I've seen reports and articles with strong growth forecasted to 2025, 2027, and even 2030. However, many trendwatchers tend to come up with new buzzwords and other fancy terminology, makes me think that their core business is ... 'coming up with new buzzwords for existing things that already have words', so how actual and true are their predictions?

Many news items that are coming from the US feature job losses and major cuts, yet at the same time the forecasts shows growth in number of jobs. Bit confusing and to be honest, as an European those cuts in the US were and still are a shock to me. When I look at EU, we can't seem to find skilled data specialists anywhere ... so how true is this sentiment then?

How does the AI adoption looks like in your region? Over here it's mainly the top companies. On the level of SME whom can benefit from something like small-scale regression models to aid analysis, the adoption is pretty low as far as I can tell.

Curious about your sights on this exciting future.

- Look at the distribution of my features. Are there any data points that are obvious outliers we should get rid of? Are my targets imbalanced -> figure out appropriate technique based on context if so. 
- Normalize my features---this step is a bit unclear for me. Previously, I would just use min max norm and hope for the best but ive recently had much better success just doing batch norm on the whole dataset. Though im not sure if there are situations where this is inappropriate. 

For neural network problems I default to just applying L2 regularization and drop out and let the network feature engineer on its own. For non-neural network problems, I would probably just do RFE or Lasso.

Coupling ML and Statistical Analysis For Completeness.,1bccwnv,"Hello all,

I'm interested in gathering your thoughts on combining machine learning and statistical analysis in a single report to achieve a more comprehensive understanding.

I'm considering including a comparative ML linear regression model alongside a traditional statistical linear regression analysis in a report. Specifically, I would present the estimated effect (e.g., Beta1) on my dependent variable (Y) and also demonstrate how the inclusion of this variable affects the predictive accuracy of the ML model.

I believe that this approach could help construct a more compelling narrative for discussions with stakeholders and colleagues.

My underlying assumption is that any feature with statistical significance should also have predictive significance, albeit probably not in the same direct - i.e Beta1 is has a positive significant effect in my statistical model but has a significant degrading effect on my predictive model. 

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and opinions on this approach.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bccwnv/coupling_ml_and_statistical_analysis_for/,AmadeusBlackwell,3,ML,35,New
"Career Paths at the Intersection of Data Science, Healthcare, and Strategy for a PhD Graduate?",1bc83ua,"**Quick background:** Close to being done with my PhD in statistics studying causal inference and machine learning in healthcare settings. 2-3 years of experience in industry + academic data science roles. Looking to see what kind of career I want to have post-grad that is a bit non-traditional for graduates of my type (usually I would go straight to research scientist, data scientist, or biostatistician roles). Wanted to get this subreddit’s opinion on what the field looks like for more high-level strategic roles.

My ideal goals are the following:

1. Applying data analysis, statistics, and ML skills to healthcare/biotech/healthtech to drive strategy and business development.
2. Interpreting the scientific literature and gathering expert opinions to build different use cases.
3. Focusing more on business problems than technical problems. Building and technical work is fine but not 100% of the time. Writing and presentations on viewpoints/strategies to non-technical people would be good.
4. Orienting myself toward strategic management roles as opposed to individual contributor/technical lead.

Some ideas:

* *Management consulting*: this would be somewhat of a “post-doc” in that I would stay only for a few years and use it to get back to (different) industry roles. I don’t know what kind of data scientist/statistician roles exist in these types of organizations. It’s also difficult to find healthcare-specific practices.
* *Health economics and outcomes research (HEOR)*: I have expertise in real-world evidence/data (RWE/RWD) so it would a be good fit. Problem is that I don’t have experience in health economics and reimbursement, which might count against me.
* *Technical product manager*: these really only appear in tech companies but I can imagine for healthtech/biotech something like this exists.

…or maybe this is all what a data scientist should be doing anyway and I've just been looking in the wrong place. Any thoughts or suggestions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1bc83ua/career_paths_at_the_intersection_of_data_science/,Zawadscki,20,Career Discussion,30,New

Need recommendations for NLP roadmap to solve business problem while growing my expertise,1bbby3x,"I'm currently working at a startup company where we are looking  forward to finetune pre-trained LLMs to solve a problem that our product  offers.

Currently we are at the stage of training an LLM so that it can work  in a specialized manner and for that I'm looking forward to expand my  knowledge in NLP. But not only that. Personally I'm also looking to  expand my knowledge in NLP, theory as well as practical implementation  to grow my expertise in this domain.   

I'm looking for recommendations for courses or roadmaps that I can  follow along to solve the business problem while also growing my  expertise in this domain.   

I have completed 2 specializations on coursera, Machine Learning  Specialization and Deep Learning Specialization. From these  specializations I've gained important and necessary fundamental  knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, and an overview of  state-of-the-art architectures related to Computer Vision and Natural  Language Processing. Now I'm looking to learn more advanced concepts and  specialized knowledge of NLP.   

I found a few courses that I am considering after researching. There are   courses available on NLP and there is also another series of Stanford  lectures CS224N. There is also another specialization on coursera  Natural Language Processing Specialization. My goal is to take course(s)  that can help me understand the theory and state-of-the-art  architectures, that really develop strong fundamental knowledge of NLP,  while I also develop strong implementation skills, keeping in mind that I  have a problem to solve in the company (training and fine tuning LLMs)  while expanding knowledge in the domain.

Hit/Miss (binary) in deal forecasting ?,1bba0bd,"hi data scientists

not sure whether anyone has seen this kind of business question in the past. 

**Context**: My department typically forecasts Sales in the monthly closing.  our deals are often million dollar level ;  in the closing there're often 40-50 deals in play 1 week ahead of the final day of closing. we usually call best/worst/forecast scenario for the final sales. 

**Deal forecast / deal quality:** For each deal, it's  in one of the 3 categories best/worst/forecast; Looking from the ""forecast"" scenario , it's either ""Forecast"" or ""Not in forecast"", i.e. Hit or miss. We don't use probability or expectation for the final number. We use a set of criteria to qualify such deal forecasting, e.g. whether customer's procurement has approved, whether customers' Board has approved this deal etc. Depending on that status , a deal could be under worst / forecast / or best scenario. 

**Business question:**  often such forecast isn't very scientific from my view. E.g.  deal A and deal B could be on the lower end of probability and very high probability , although both A and B are in ""forecast"" . Anyone has used a more sophisticated method to do such forecasting? Given the quantity of deals , it wouldn't be anything worth doing  machine learning I guess. But is it worth using probability and deal value weighted by probability based on the deal quality?

# TLDR

**upsetty** is a Python package I built to create UpSet plots and visualize intersecting sets. You can use the project yourself by installing with:

    pip install upsetty 

Project GitHub Page: [https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty](https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty)

Project PyPI Page: [https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/](https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/)

# Background

Recently I received a work assignment where the business partners wanted us to analyze the overlap of users across different platforms within our digital ecosystem, with the ultimate goal of determining which platforms are underutilized or driving the most engagement.

When I was exploring the data, I realized I didn't have a great mechanism for visualizing set interactions, so I started looking into [UpSet plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UpSet_Plot). I think these diagrams are a much more elegant way of visualizing overlapping sets than alternatives such as Venn and Euler diagrams. I consulted [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@narayanmahto/visualizing-intersecting-sets-upset-chart-in-python-cf72e4cad5b1) that purported to explain how to create these plots in Python, but the instructions seemed to have been ripped directly from the projects' GitHub pages, which have not been updated in several years.

[One project by Lex et. al 2014](https://upset.app/) seems to work fairly well, but it has that 'matplotlib-esque' look to it. In other words, it seems visually outdated. I like creating views with libraries like Plotly, because it has a more modern look and feel, but noticed there is no UpSet figure available in the figure factory. So, I decided to create my own.

# Introducing 'upsetty'

[upsetty](https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty) is a new Python package [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/) that you can use to create upset plots to visualize intersecting sets. It's built with Plotly, and you can change the formatting/color scheme to your liking.

I need to show how grateful I am to this sub,1b8ym5o,"Thanks you guys fpr every single book recommendation, for every single career advice.

I took your recommendations seriously, studied the books you told me to study, and studied other videos on my own, learning everything I can learn on my own.

Then I took the advice someone here told is to talk to someone internally in the data science team, turns out, they were impressed by the scope of the projects I worked on for a sales analyst and how I improved everything data-related in the department and the lead told me once I am ready (I still have a probability course to finish and recap hands on ML) and I will be up for a transfer.

I will be a junior DS in 5 or 6 months time after being an analyst for 2 years (I started when I was 20) and it's all you guys, so, thanks. 

Edit: here's everything:

I started when I was 18 years old, in something that I never knew it would be my gate to this job: a sales agent. Been so for a whole year. This gave me a lot of business context, how a manager leads people under him, and how his manager looks at his performance and understood something about the hierarchical behavior of companies. 
Then, I left the job after a year, now it's the pandemic, I spent it leqrning Excel and basic statistics, all on YouTube.

Moving forward to when I was 20, I had no idea a data analyst is even a title, and got a job as an accountant at a small workshop, with college going on, and I was studying business administration and statistics.
The job was never an accountant or have anything to do with accounting, my manager at the time was a very smart guy, working with pen and paper as his ledger, then I introduced Excel, he was all in for it, I started creating tables for our sales and inventory and customers and places we work in.

He started asking questions, you said last month we made 40K, how come we make 45 this month? I started digging into our data unknowingly doing analysis.

His brother was a regular visitor, I learned that he is the head of data at a big startup in our country, saw what I did, kept giving me tasks and I answer with Excel.

Then, he gave me a course that I highly recommend about Excel: power tools in Excel, you can find sources on YouTube for it a lot (power query, power pivot and data modeling). I started applying DAX, and here comes my first book [Dax Guide](https://www.google.com.eg/books/edition/_/dtr8oQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQo4eZ8OKEAxUXgP0HHXfgDTIQ7_IDKAB6BAgPEAM).

Then I started my LinkedIn journey, showing Excel and powerBI dashboards and applying to jobs, in data analysis, really that's all you need, business context, some technical tools to help you dig into the data and answer questions.

Then, I started reading about data science, how statistics is important and how much I liked it in college, here goes the second book, [Naked Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data-ebook/dp/B007Q6XLF2).
Here I learned to think with stats a bit.

Then, I found that I lack implementation to a lot of concepts to statistics, people recommended python for me, here there were two sources for me to learn from, YouTube courses got me up and running into how to write simple code in python and understand the syntax.

Later, DataCamp had tracks, I finished the Data Analyst with python and another one data analyst with SQL. This helped me BIG time in knowing where to go next. 

Note: I was doing all of that while working and being in college.

The DataCamp course had great courses about statistics and probability and simulation. While also practicing SQL, I got really good with it.

Now, got a job as a junior sales ops analyst (my role now). I got lucky, working on real problems and practicing what I learn.

Then started moving back to books, but I lacked problem solving mindset, read these books: [Stop Guessing](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Guessing-Behaviors-Problem-Solvers/dp/162656986X) and[Lean Analytics](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

This helped me big time understand how my work affects the company. 

Now it's time to show your work to stakeholders, I read this book: [Storytelling with data](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).

It's time to go back to the details of my job, It was all querying on metabase, an open source BI tool.

I was responsible for giving agents retailers to visit, so, Every morning, we are supposed to apply filters on our data (last order date, last visit date and some other features ) and tell the agent, visit 20 of those retailers and go home. I was doing all of that in an automated fashion with power query, creating automated pipelines was my passion in Excel. All I had to do was give it an updated file from our database, refresh the pipeline, take the new file, dump it into our system.

They do visit 20 retailers, but the problem reached the tech team, the data was too much to handle, requiring us to give a smaller set of retailers for the agents, specifically 40 retailers.

But how do we guarantee they are close to each other? Here come my first interaction with adata scientist.

I did all what I did in Excel but in python using pandas and then reached the point where I don't know how to give clusters.

He took my jupyter notebook, gave it to us back with the solution to our problem, with something I was not familiar with at the time, Kmeans constrained.
Which took only longitude, latitude gave each agent his route of 40 retailers.

I started taking notes from his improvements to my code and asked him, what did you do?

He told my my code was fine, but you used a lot of custom functions on operations that can be vectorized, I asked for a book recommendation about vectorized operations in pandas here, the guys recommended this [Data Wrangling in python book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Tools-Easier/dp/1491948817).

After that book, I was obsessed with data automation in python using pandas and numpy only.

I got also obsessed with vectorizing any operation in our code base, read something pandas specific now: [Effective Pandas](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).

Then, it was the part where he interacted with our system API.

Since all our company data scientists and swes have access to snowflake and live databases, we, analysts, had access to only metabase.

I saw this as an opportunity to get known!

I wrote two functions used by our entire company, ret_metabase and interact_with_google_sheets
The first one connects to the API endpoint and then takes your credintials and the makes a session ID and gets your card ID string response in json and I convert it to a dataframe. The second requires an Api key, thenenables tge user to do anything with a google sheet, remove data set with a dataframe get data asa dataframe append on data filter views really anything in one function.
How did I learn to do all of that? A course on youtube , just type API development in python amd a book about data structures, [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM). This helped big time in optimizing my code performance and writing cleaner code.

I got known and these functions are in the companies library now and people use it all the time. And I even left funny comments in the documentation and Everything.

The kmeans thing got me really interested in machine learning and here's the first book you guys recommended: [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/).

It was really hard for me at first because I had not been introduced properly to those three topics:
1- linear algebra
2- calculus
3- probability and statistics
I took [Jon Krohn's live lessions](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations) it's free on YouTube.

But those three were later taken (started linear algebra in November 23).

So I struggled back then and here, another book was suggested: Hands-on ML.

I finished it and was really fucking hyped to apply the stuff I learned directly into my job, even without my manager permissions.

But that was not enough, I did not know what I should do to impact our compqny, what is data science?

I read this book: [Data science with business, what you need to know about DS](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323)

First thing I dod after understanding what kmeans is, improved our routes clustering function by standerdizing the scales of the long, lat, giving it another column ( retailer rank) that rankstarts at the maximum value the longitude and decays linearly from 31 to 30 (longitude here is from 30 to 31), I used linspace and select in numpy here to give retailers ranks. This rank was business objective (give 31 toretailers with high conversion and then 30.9 to retailers with monotonically decreasing nmv to make them order back and so on...) Any other retailer takes a zero in his face. This helped in giving optimized distance to retailers we really need to visit.

This gave us a big boost in agents strike rate and overall performance.

Second, I applied xgboost, predicting who will place an order today if visited. Gave them the biggest rank.

Testing this was a must, so I learned about A/B testing, and some other great bootstrapping ideas here [Practical Statistics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) Book.

This pushed our strike rate from 40 to 73%.

Then, I really now see that I lack probability knowledge and maths knowledge to be a data scientist, so I read [Essential maths for DS](https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098102932).

Since my job was about sales operations, it was a necessary thing to automate discovering new sales areas and opportunity, previously, we used to draw polygons in areas we want to open, and then the agents are set there to wander and find retailers on their own.

I got an idea, how about I get all streets know in this area and make blocks in the intersections and then convert the coords to google maps link and give 50 daily sequential links to agents to discover areas in a more naturally sequential way? I used omnix API to get streets data and geopandas to make all other operations, I learned how to work with geopandas from their docs, really straightforward.

This project was big, applied everything I know about pandas and data structures and business knowledge to do it, and it's up and running now.

I got praised for it and the head of data was impressed with the result and decided to give me access to snowflake directly to limit requests on metabase as the data was big and then I scaled the project to all regions we operate in.

Then it was time to speak with the senior ds lead.

I showed him all I wrote here, he recommended I get a strong foundation in linear algebra and calculus and probability.

I got it, and now working on probability and statistics.

I then told him I am really into causal inference (rwcommended by someone in my previous post here) and regression analysis.

He said that's exactly what they need from the junior they want to hire, ""anyone can fit and predict nowdays"" he said, ""we need someone who can make an impact in all the stuff we don't have time for and teach him more cloud tools and maybe he gives us new ideas or show us new tools"" he elaborated.

Right now I am studying probability and statistics and then will study [Causal Inference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/causal-inference-in/9781098140243/).


I guess that's all, the most important thing is that you keep studying and never giving up, please, focus more on business context as it's overlooked.

How to move from Prediction to Inference: Gaussian Process Regression,1b8xjyb,"Hello!

This is my first time posting here, so please forgive my naivety.

For the past few weeks, I've been trying to understand how to extract causal inference information from models that seem to be primarily predictive. Specifically, I've been working with Gaussian Process Regression using some crime data and learning how to better tune it to improve predictions. However, I'm uncertain about how to move from there to making statements about the effects of my X variables on the variance of my Y, or (from a Bayesian perspective) which distribution most credibly explains my Y given my set of Xs.

I'm wondering if I'm missing some fundamental understanding here, or if GPR simply can't be used to make causal statements.

Any critique or information you can provide would be greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b8xjyb/how_to_move_from_prediction_to_inference_gaussian/,AmadeusBlackwell,16,Analysis,20,New
Realistic to pursue a career in datascience and the requirements needed.,1b8qj21,"Hi all.

I'm a semi ""new graduate"" with a bsc in cognitive science, with 1 year work experience in a job that never had any relevance to my degree whatsoever, hence i left. It was like being a bike mechanic asked to fix cars. Well that's what it felt like anyway.

I come from a background where people who continue and finish their masters, often go into datascience careers. In my country a bsc also means very little, it's unusual to ""only"" have a bsc to begin with, masters are an expectation. So finding a new and relevant job is already challenging.

When I look at this sub I've come to realise I have no clue what I'd be doing or expected to do in such a position. I find it unnerving and I feel completely incompetent. I can't work out if a background with strong knowledge of statistics, frequentist and bayesian, is enough to pursue anything related to datascience? I currently only apply for data analytics, and have been avoiding anything called datascience, and anything that mentions ML and/or MLOps entirely. I simply don't know enough. 

I just find datascience to be interesting, but unlike analytics, more programming heavy? 

My questions are:

* Can I move onto datascience from analytics, will I gain enough insight?
* Would learning by doing in a job be enough? I can do R, I realise I need to at least get familiar with SQL, and probably python. This sub dabbles in so many things, that's completely out of my depth.
* Should I bail on this entirely, and go back to uni?

I just have an overall feeling of being completely incompetent. My time away from uni, doing a what felt like an unrelated job, has left me feeling even more useless and lacking in skills. Even data analytics feels too far gone, and I worry I can't remember anything if I managed to get a job again. I fucking love analytics, I love wrangling data, analysing outputs and results, trying to determine the best way to solve problems through models etc. Most analytic jobs just look to be the very basics. I don't think I'd be happy doing that long-term. I just don't know if datascience would be a realistic avenue to pursue, nor do I fully understand what would be expected of me on the jobmarket.


I apologise for the wall of text. I think I needed to vent a little.

How would you approach this interview question?,1b853sy,"So this was my first ""data science"" interview where I was asked (what I think) was a business case. Apparently I did soo poorly I got handed a rejection a few hours later, so I wanted to know what you guys think of this problem, how you would solve it, if it's even an appropriate DS question etc...

The problem goes something like this: You are a data scientist that works at an e-commerce platform that sells experiences at Paris (think bicycle rides, wine tours, etc...). The company doesn't own any products but rather takes a commission from every product sold.

You have access to a table of 500 such products (for Paris only) that has columns like title, category, review count, review avg, price, duration, when it was posted, etc... (maybe 2-3 more but these seem more like internal IDs that don't really matter). The three questions we went over before she gave up on me were:

1. How would you pick 1-2 metrics from this column to sort these listings? (To build a quick formula for ranking these listings)
2. What are some disadvantages of this approach?
3. How would you predict that the rankings will change in 6 months from today (assuming I implemented my strategy)?

My answers where:

1. I would pick the review avg and count. normalize the count, like minmax so that it is in the same range as the review avg, and weight the review count and review avg by a alpha and (1 - alpha) for example. Should have I picked price instead of review count? I didn't because I would assume that the revenue generated per product would be somewhat similar (I also asked how they take commission and the answer I got was to use price as the proxy for commission which imo makes no sense, the rates wouldn't be the same for all of the prices right?), otherwise they would not have signed that product plus, for longer term growth I would assume UX would be more important that money generated short term, i.e. recommend things that the user would like more... should have I used the inverse of the review count to treat this problem more like a multi armed bandit with the UCB strategy?
2. I said that this approach wouldn't give a higher ranking to newer products and that it would be more dificult for these new products to rank
3. I pretty much said the same as 2. because I also gave up around here

The questions I have are: why ask a question that doesn't allow me to use ML? I understand having a baseline, but still... I briefly mentioned multi armed bandits and she overlooked what I said. If this was a business case why didn't I get more context? I asked what was the bigger context, if this was for a ranking algorithm, and got a not very convincing ""sure"" (tbh using the term ""sort"" here somewhat confused me, I usually see the term ""ranking"" for these problems, it looked like she was avoiding it for some reason). I then asked what was their current approach for sorting these listings and she didn't answer...",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b853sy/how_would_you_approach_this_interview_question/,AromaticCantaloupe19,67,Discussion,64,New
Research or software development,1b84uff,"Dear hive mind, I'm in the fortunate position to have offers for two positions. They pay both basically the same however
1. Position 1 is in a large, multinational company which is currently modernizing it's product portfolio and invests heavily in research and development, where I would work on ML models for all sorts of products. I would be required to be at the office about 50% of the time and attendance is tracked using some app. The tech stack is somewhat out of date but modernizing it would be part of my tasks. Here I could learn a lot about several different domains of machine learning and data science. 
2. Position 2 is at a former startup which was recently bought by a larger company. I would have 100% wfh and a very modern tech stack, however my work would focus strongly on a very narrow range of models which are interesting to one single industry. However, this company is basically a software company so that I could learn a lot about software development and ML engineering. 

So what position would you take? I tend towards position 1 because I liked doing research at university (did my PhD in math) but position 2 seems to have better benefits and engineering is interesting as well? Also I think the skills I learn at position 1 are more valuable when switching jobs again, but I'm not sure about that. 

What would be the key factors you are looking for when considering a new position? 

Thank you all in advance.

National Lab LLNL -  Here we are working on the nuclear fusion process and trying to improve  it through hands on work and from what I was told will also be using  deep learning. I got this internship from doing research already, so I  would kind of be doing the same work as I am doing in research.

Lockheed  Martin - Operations Engineer Intern - Working on  production plans,  forecasting methods (Learning Curves, Parametric Estimates), statistical  analysis (Regression Analysis), database operations (Data Mining, SQL  Statements) .

Please let me know if I need to add any details or clarify!

\*\*\*\*UPDATE: Contrary to popular opinions, I ended up choosing the USAA position for a number of reasons. 

It's a new field, so I am trying to see something different. It's also a field that is used in healthcare, sports, and almost every field. I was going to be doing the same work at the the national lab that I am already doing in research, meaning my resume would have two experience sections with practically the same bullets. 

USAA gives return offers to a high percentage of interns and pays for masters. They have much better facilities and much better benefits. It is also much closer to where I live so if I go there full time it isn't that far from family. Lockheed also gives return positions to a lot of people. The national lab, I'm not sure and I'm also not interested in living in California. 

Not that I care too much about money, because a few thousand is not a lot in the long run, but USAA and Lockheed had higher salaries and gave money for housing while the national lab did not.

There is a machine learning role in risk at USAA that is similar to the credit risk role and maybe something I could move to as a master's student or maybe a full time role. Lockheed operations and machine learning are completely 2 different things. National Lab has you work on different projects that probably have machine learning in each role, which is the best. 

I mainly rejected the National Lab due to the fact that my work would be the same as my research, nothing new, kind of in the dark about return offers, don't want to live in a small city in California (not during the internship but if taken for full time), not as good benefits as the other two. The good is that it would probably have the most meaningful work and has machine learning in it. 

I mainly rejected Lockheed since I've heard from some people that you don't really do much on the role, it's just excel and tableau and trying to improve some things with six sigma principles. Pay was the highest and had good benefits with high chance of full time offer, but wasn't interested in the work. 

There are other factors that I can't remember off the top of my head, but these were the main ones. I may be wrong in my reasons but this is what I believed in.

How do you guys document your models?,1b7mrdm,"I work at a company that does quantitative pricing for sporting events. We have a variety of models, but there is no documentation. To understand how a model works, you need to read through the code. Now, I'm in favour of writing good code such that someone CAN read through it to understand what is going on. However, I believe there are certain benefits to having a document that outlines the approach, compares it with others etc. While we produce a semi-technical project report to disseminate to stakeholders, I'd like to also document the deep technical dive.  


My team is familiar with LaTeX, and I am currently thinking about including Overleaf in our workflows to encourage some rigour and proper documentation. However, if a slight change is urgently made to the model's code, should that be reflected in the LaTeX document? How should the document be versioned?

Non-monotonic survival approaches?!,1b6qa04,"I am attempting to predict survival for individuals within a group. What I find in EDA is that they exhibit an increase in event up until about half way through the total observation period, then experience a decrease in the chance of event in the second half. Think the inverse of human survival: we have higher mortality rate at birth and that decreases as we age, but then swings back up once we crest “the hill” as it were. 

In my observed group, “mortality” is very low to negligible at the onset of “life,” increases for about a year, then slowly falls off for the remaining 2 years. 

Models I’ve experimented with (only PH and AFT) trend towards 100% “mortality,” with an increasing rate towards year 3 massively diverging from observed reality. Otherwise I’m getting ok results within 1 year. 

My observations have two end states, bad_event and successful_completion. Censoring isn’t a concern in this group, they all have one or the other of these and cannot experience bad_event after completion. Both are terminal events (we’re trying to predict time of bad_event is it ever happens). 

So my understanding is that PH and AFT might not be best for this pattern of behavior. But I’m not sure where else to start with modeling it. And maybe I’m just too inexperienced with survival altogether so I may need some clarification with the assumptions I’m making.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b6qa04/nonmonotonic_survival_approaches/,renok_archnmy,8,Discussion,21,New

Best approach to predicting one KPI based on the performance of another?,1b5j49v,"Basically I’d like to be able to determine how one KPI should perform based on the performance of anotha related KPI. 

For example let’s say I have three KPIs: avg daily user count, avg time on platform, and avg daily clicks count. If avg daily user count for the month is 1,000 users then avg daily time on platform should be x and avg daily clicks should be y. If avg daily time on platform is 10 minutes then avg daily user count should be x and avg daily clicks should be y.

Is there a best practice way to do this? Some form of correlation matrix or multi v regression? 

Thanks in advance for any tips or insight


EDIT: Adding more info after responding to a comment.

This exercise is helpful for triage. Expanding my example, let’s say I have 35 total KPIs (some much more critical than others - but 35 continuous variable metrics that we track in one form or another) all around a user platform and some KPIs are upstream/downstream chronologically of other KPIs e.g. daily logins is upstream of daily active users. Also, of course we could argue that 35 KPIs is too many, but that’s what my team works with so it’s out of my hands.

Let’s say one morning we notice our avg daily clicks KPI is much lower than expected. Our first step is usually to check other highly correlated metrics to see how those have behaved during the same period.

What I want to do is quantify and rank those correlations so we have a discreet list to check. If that makes sense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b5j49v/best_approach_to_predicting_one_kpi_based_on_the/,yrmidon,22,Analysis,19,New

I'm looking for team mates to participate in Kaggle competitions as part of the learning process. My focus will be on getting a 'live' problem that needs to be solved, reflecting reality as much possible as opposed to tutorials where the solution is given, and the sense of commitment and accountability.

I don't want to be overly optimistic by saying ""Let's get a group together and we ride forever!"" ... no, **let's start with one** ;-)

I'm looking for people who are able to commit to a weekly meet at the least. Members that focus mainly on personal improvement and less on the contest/prize/swag. People that enjoy collaboration.

A Data science manager is just a manager,1b4inht,"As a data scientist from the days before it was a buzzword, I've had the hard journey from frustration over the lack of innovative projects at my company to ascending the ranks with the aim of being in the position to spearheading such initiatives. Initially, I thought the barrier was a lack of vision among decision-makers, but as I climbed the corporate ladder, I discovered the real challenge was not just creating groundbreaking projects, but ensuring their adoption within the company. Despite becoming proficient at the art of selling ideas and achieving some significant successes, the demands of management now consume all my time. I find myself mired in meetings, one-on-ones, and endless slide decks, leaving no space for the very innovation I sought to promote. This paradox highlighted a crucial lesson: having the power to initiate change doesn't guarantee the capacity to execute it, especially in a field where the talent for both data science and leadership is rare. The question then becomes: how do you find the balance?

I have a masters in applied Econ. I’ve worked with SAS, SQL, some Python, and alteryx. I have tried for so many years to try to get into data analytics or data science but have never gotten anywhere and I’ve basically lost hope at this point.

Classification model on pet health insurance claims data with strong imbalance,1b3pki9,"I'm currently working on a project aimed at predicting pet insurance claims based on historical data. Our dataset includes 5 million rows, capturing both instances where claims were made (with a specific condition noted) and years without claims (indicated by a NULL condition). These conditions are grouped into 20 higher-level categories by domain experts. Along with that each breed is grouped into a higher-level grouping.

I am approaching this as a supervised learning problem in the same way found in this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36023-5), treating each pet's year as a separate sample. This means a pet with 7 years of data contributes 7 samples(regardless of if it made a claim or not), with features derived from the preceding years' data and the target (claim or no claim) for that year. My goal is to create a binary classifier for each of the 20 disease groupings, incorporating features like recency (e.g., skin\_condition\_last\_year, skin\_condition\_claim\_avg and so on for each disease grouping), disease characteristics (e.g., pain\_score), and breed groupings. So, one example would be a model for skin conditions for example that would predict given the preceding years info if the pet would have a skin\_condition claim in the next year.

 The big challenges I am facing are:

* Imbalanced Data: For each disease grouping, positive samples (i.e., a claim was made) constitute only 1-2% of the data.
* Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting claims is challenging, along with finding relevant features to create.

Current Strategies Under Consideration:

*  Logistic Regression: Adjusting class weights,employing Repeated Stratified Cross-Validation, and threshold tuning for optimisation.
* Gradient Boosting Models: Experimenting with CatBoost and XGBoost, adjusting for the imbalanced dataset.
* Nested Classification: Initially determining whether a claim was made before classifying the specific disease group.

 I'm seeking advice from those who have tackled similar modelling challenges, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets and feature selection. Any insights on the methodologies outlined above, or recommendations on alternative approaches, would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if you’ve come across relevant papers or resources that could aid in refining my approach, that would be amazing.

Algorithm to detect Concept Drift,1b2vg0u,"All ML models are designed to do one thing: learning a probability distribution in the form of P(y|X). In other words, they try to learn how to model an outcome 'y' given the input variables 'X'. 

This probability distribution, P(y|X), is also called Concept. Therefore, if the Concept changes, the model may become invalid.

But how do we know if there is a new Concept in our data?  
Or, more importantly, how do we measure if the new Concept is affecting the model's performance?

Here is a clever solution where the main ingredients are a reference dataset, one where the model's performance is known, and a dataset with the latest data we would like to monitor.

**Step-by-Step solution:**

1. We start by training an internal model on a chunk of the latest data. -> This allows us to learn the new possible Concept presented in the data.
2. Next, we use the internal model to make predictions on the reference dataset.
3. We then estimate the model's performance on the reference dataset, assuming the model's predictions on the monitoring data as ground truth.
4. If the estimated performance of the internal model and the actual monitored model are very different, we then say that there has been a Concept Drift.

To quantify how this Concept impacts performance, we subtract the actual model's performance on reference from the estimated performance and report a delta of the performance metric. -> This is what the plot below shows. The change of the F1-score due to Concept drift!   


This process is repeated for every new chunk of data that we get.

Looking for Insights on My Data Science Journey and Stack Adaptation,1b1ywp7," Hello Data Sciences community,

I am a data scientist with a background in NLP, having earned my MSc from a top-notch European Engineering School, with a focus on deep learning within NLP. My experience spans almost two years as an NLP research scientist at a medical research institute. Recently, I've taken a significant turn in my career path. In December, I returned to my homeland, a charming yet technologically nascent French island, to continue my data science journey. The tech scene here seems to lag by about 5-8 years compared to major hubs like Paris, predominantly in data maturity levels. Local companies are just beginning to recognize the value of data, mainly focusing on data engineering to organize and store their data effectively. The biggest insutries here are tourism, mass-retail, civil engineering, agriculture, transports and medical.

Currently, I serve as the sole full-stack data scientist in an auditing and accounting firm, a role that encompasses both data engineering and analysis. My responsibilities include developing internal data solutions for auditing purposes and external solutions for our accounting services. The solutions primarily involve building databases linked to interactive dashboards, occasionally integrating forecasting models or leveraging large language models (LLMs) as needed.

For dashboard development, I utilize Plotly Dash, which facilitates both front-end and back-end development in Python, allowing for the creation of comprehensive web applications. These applications support user authentication and authorization, dashboard access control, and interaction with various analysis cycles. My work heavily involves PostgreSQL for database management, with a continuous effort to automate and optimize data processing. Currently, I'm exploring efficient methods to allow non-technical users to upload CSV files for automatic cleaning and integration into our databases, using PySpark for automation. The infrastructure is based on Linux servers, with Docker for containerization and Docker Swarm for container orchestration across different servers. Monitoring the state of our servers is an area I'm looking to improve, potentially through custom scripting or other recommended solutions.

Despite my extensive experience in NLP research, my current role demands a broad set of skills, requiring me to quickly adapt and learn on the job. Given the company's size (about 100 employees) and the island's population (around 800,000), I've had to tailor my approach to fit our specific needs and limitations.

I am curious about the community's thoughts on my current data science stack. I'm aware of more modern stacks involving technologies like Databricks, Looker, and Kubernetes. Do you think my current setup is adequate for the **company's scale** and the **local tech ecosystem's maturity**? Any insights or suggestions, especially regarding automated data cleaning solutions or server monitoring, would be greatly appreciated (opensource and free).

Advice Wanted: Modeling Customer Migration,1b1slj4,"Hi r/datascience :) Google didn't help much, so I've come here.

I'm a relatively new data scientist with <1 YOE, and my team is responsible for optimizing customer contact channels at our company. 

Our main goal at present is to predict which customers are likely to migrate from a high-cost contact channel (call center) to a lower cost channel (digital chat). We have a number of ways to target these customers in order to promote digital chat. Ideally, we'd take the model predictions (in this case, a customer with high likelihood to adopt chat) and more actively promote the channel to them.

I have some ideas about how to handle the modeling process, so I'm mostly looking for advice and tips from people who've worked on similar kinds of projects. How did your models perform? Any mistakes you could have avoided? Is this kind of endeavor a fool's errand?

i think i built the easiest way for python developers to interact with the cloud (and at a massive scale),1b0zcek,"over the last 6 months I've become obsessed with the cloud abstraction space. the more I started to dig the more it made me realized that adoption has been super low... way lower than it should be. it appears that adoption has been incredibly low because the existing solutions are prohibitively complex, costly, and don't meet organizational security compliance. 

this research along with many user interviews led me to the creation of [Burla](https://www.burla.dev/). this is the world's simplest cluster compute software. it scales across thousands of computers in the cloud with no setup and one line of code.  

Burla is...

* free and open source software
* installable in your cloud with one command
* available as a managed services at 1/3 the price of other abstractions
* a python package with one function and two arguments
* a tool that just works. The developer experience is local and it re-raises exceptions and streams output locally. Packages are automatically synced, we clone your local env and then cache it.

happy to elaborate more on features in functionality, I will be releasing the open source and managed version over the next couple of weeks. I hope this is able to deliver a massive amount of value to the python community. it should be incredibly simple for all python developers irrespective of their skillset to easily leverage cloud resources.

"Does the average SHAP value for a given metric, say anything about the value/magnitude of the metric itself?",1b0vulb,"Let's say we have a dataset of Overwatch games for a single player. The data includes metrics like elims, deaths, # of character swaps, etc, with a binary target column of whether they won the game or not.

For this scenario, we are interested in only deaths, and making a recommendation based off the model. Let's say that after training the model, we find that the average SHAP value for deaths is 0.15 - this SHAP value ranks 4 of all the metrics.

***My first question is: can we say that this is the 4th most ""important"" feature as it relates to whether this player will win or lose the game, even if this isn't 100% known or totally comprehensive?***

Regardless, does this SHAP value relate at all to the values within the feature itself? For example, we intuitively know that high deaths is a bad thing in Overwatch, but low deaths could also mean that this player is being way too conservative and not helping their team, which is actually contributing to them losing.

***My last question is: is there any way, given a SHAP value for a feature, to know whether that feature being big is a good or bad thing?***

I understand that there are manual, domain-specific ways to go about this. But is there a way that's ""just good enough, even if not totally comprehensive"" to figure out if a metric being big is a good thing when trying to predict a win or loss?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b0vulb/does_the_average_shap_value_for_a_given_metric/,NFeruch,7,ML,16,New

I have heard views in favour of both approaches - in case of in house expertise, change management is easier and every change request is not accompanied by a significant billing amount whereas in case of external firm/outsourcing, the argument is that they are better at solving problems because it's their core competency and they know the best practices having worked with multiple firms on different problems. I have even heard sharp criticism of in house Data Science team in such companies being referred as ""white elephant"" or having higher ask on the business team in terms of process mapping etc whereas external firms are capable of doing both process mapping, redesign and implementation themselves.

Advice for Career Switch,1ayofnt,"
Hey! 

I feel very stuck.

Summary: Graduated with degrees in Data Science and Business from an Ivy. Got too into the Investment Banking/Finance rat race. Realized I hated it midway. Ended up in a FinTech firm doing mediocre level work (started with a financy role but now have some form of a data analyst role?). Want to break into Data Science but feel overwhelmed and left behind because of I missed out on math, stats, and ML coursework/practice. (International student btw)

More details:
I started college with my business degree at an Ivy. Everyone was so crazy about Investment Banking / Consulting that I started to envision myself doing it when in reality I never gave a shit about it. I was always good at Math and Physics but I just never touched it in that pursuit. 

Took a programming course midway through college (pandemic times) and realized thats what I wanted to do more of. Did the bare minimum to finish a data science degree but didn’t have any good projects/experience to be competent enough to apply. (P.S. biggest mistake that I feel like I made. Always scared to apply coz I thought too low of myself). 

Juggling these two degrees while trying too hard to break into Wall Street took away my time and attention. I knew I had the technicalities of it right but just the whole NeTwOrkIng and Culture got to me. 

Ended by in a basic finance role with no career progression or exit opportunities. Made an internal shift towards a quantitative role. Currently work on data analysis (descriptive at best) and built dashboard/tools of that. Can’t be more complicated since its a finance firm.

Now I am 2 years in with no H1B yet. Keep thinking about a masters or somehow segway into tech. Tech’s not looking great these days. I have a strong understanding of intro stats but thats basically it. Have some sloppy ML and data science projects that I barely remember any details of to talk about. I do not know how to do better since I feel like I need to do everything. Would really really wish I had some form of a mentor to guide me but what do I do? Reach out to strangers to ask them to be my mentor?

Having a hard time to make my next move...,1axvoz6," 

Hello there, I am just about to finish my degree in Applied Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. I have a passion for DS which mainly started during my 2nd year and i kept at it until getting some knowledge about the tools and the theories. I have also participated in projects here and there plus have gathered more than a year of research experience in computational chemistry.

Considering the market situation and everything, i am still determining what i want to do in the coming days. I want to go into the industry/work line as my first choice. Academics is also a choice i might consider.

I mainly want to integrate my passion for DS with chemistry/chemical engineering as i dont want my 4-year degree to go to waste and I also keep my domain expertise at least. right now i have these options-

1. Get admitted to the masters classes in the same dept which doesnt require the results of my bachelor's (as its the same dept) and try to contact professors or recruiters that will take me for a chem/chemE + Ds position. Note that trying to get a master's other than my dept will take me 6-7 months more compared to my peers as my results will take that much time to be published.

2. go to the capital city and pursue a master's in cse with a major in data science while applying for DS related jobs to get that credibility and experience as there isnt many job position in DS in my current city.

3. Will fully transitioning to DS be a good choice? i think its a risky move as ill be competing with cse/cs/stats grads who are already buffed up to begin with, which makes me much even more unlikely to get selected.

Tbh, i want to go into the industry/work line as my first choice. For now, my best bet is to get out of my country as there is little to no oppurtunities for chemical engineering as well as ds.

I have the choice between 2 internships : software engineering vs recommendation system deployment. Which one should I pick ?,1axutit,"I have an education in data science and MLOps. 

I have been approached by the CEO of a company who does the recruitment himself. (He had few successful companies and that one is in its second year). He was looking for a data type of profile + software engineering skills. There is a bit of ML on the roadmap but most of the work would be SE. I have close to 0 SE skills yet and I did let him know this. I think we clicked fairly well, he asked me if I was willing to learn it and I told him I was. I might be wrong but I think an experience with SE might be a good idea to differentiate myself from other candidates in the future, especially with the state of the market. It would be a little team, friend - colleagues type of environment. 

Now the second offer, in case I've been convincing enough during my technical interview and they reach back to me :

A DS onsultant is working for a client and he requires an intern capable of deploying on the cloud. The man was a bit dry in my opinion and I was reminded several times that there is competition for the internship (there is 4 other candidates).

From a pragmatic perspective, the DS position seems better suited to my career aspiration (wanna work in NLP). From a human perspective I think the SE position would be a better experience.

How to prepare myself for next role as NLP Engineer/DS?,1axqwyj,"My current position is Senior Data Scientist, it is my second role, before that I was a DS consultant and I have about 4-5 yoe, depends on you count it. 

I have been working at my current place for about 2 years, and I got to the point where my learning is bounded. I am very appreciated at my current workplace, and I had the luck of entering to the company at a good time, so I took part in the development of several central pipelines, and saw our product become profitable. For the past six months, however, I have been feeling stuck and frustrated. Due to bad management we are now micro-managed by our CEO. It doesn't look like I have a lot of place to grow, and my direct manager isn't at a point he can guild me on ML and has a very modest technical stack to be generous. 

For the past year, I started to develop interest in NLP, and since then I did on my spare time a lot of learning and some side project in varying complexity. In my work as well, I was able to push for using some of the things that I learned (also by doing extra hours, but it was for me as well). So far I led a project were we trained a RoBERTa model from scratch, including tokenization as we deal with somewhat a different domain than the off-the-shelf pre-trained datasets are familiar with. I also trained more modest models including siamese network to learn similarity between strings of different sources, and a Word2Vec for word embeddings when the use case made more sense than using contextual embeddings. All of the above are projects that ended up being delivered to customers, which I led from a-z.

I know that in four months or so, I would like to start looking for a new place, and I know that I am looking for a place where I could deepen my knowledge about working with textual data. In the meantime I am trying to read as many papers as my time allows (both inside and outside of work), and I try to look for problems I can solve with NLP in my current workplace. Our main product is based on classification and we are heavily focus on low latency, so with these two limitations, I am struggling to see how transformer decoders (LLMs) can help. 

I don't know if the above would suffice to land a first job as an NLP engineer/DS in a company that focuses on textual data. **I am wondering what can I do in order to set myself apart from other candidates, and what hiring managers in such companies look for in a prospective candidate**.

How often to retrain the time series forecasting model?,1axdyu8,"I have a weekly time series model, with 8 weeks as the forecasting horizon. There are 4 exogenous variables, which I forecast also 8 weeks ahead and use as the input for the target variable forecast.

I understand the models like classification does not need to be retrained very often. With the sensitive of the time series, I think it would be necessary to include the new data especially the data is less granular like weekly.

How to deal with missing values,1axcgfo,"Hello,

I know this topic has been extensively covered, but I haven't found an answer that suits my needs.

I'm currently interning and working on electronic boards.

These electronic boards go through test benches. The test lasts about 3 hours if the board is compliant; otherwise, as soon as an anomaly appears, the test stops. This is the source of my missing values.

My topic is as follows: a number of these rejected boards are false negatives (a board detected as defective when it is actually compliant).

Therefore, I'm looking to create a machine learning model to predict the false negatives in order to analyze the most influential parameters and correct them.

However, missing values are a real problem for me, plus my data is highly imbalanced (m <<<< n), which doesn't make my job any easier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1axcgfo/how_to_deal_with_missing_values/,omitna,4,ML,11,New

"Education beyond a Masters, is it necessary?",1ax6dgp,"With a BS + MS in Statistics I don’t really have any plans to do a PhD. I am more interested in solving problems in the industry than in academia. However, part of me feels “weird” that my education is gonna stop at 24 and I will be working and not getting another degree. But that’s besides the point. My real concern is whether I need to plan on getting some kind of “professional” degree after my MS in Stats. When I interviewed for a role the hiring manager (who had no background in anything stem) told me I should consider an MBA to round myself out. Frankly I have no interest in doing an MBA. I’ve gone debt free for my education my whole life (thank you parents for bachelors, and thank you to myself for getting funding for my masters), but in no way do I want to pay for an MBA. 

From my limited experience it feels like MBAs are just degrees people get to prove to a higher up that they have the credential to get a c suite position. Cause ultimately people hire people and if the directors or c suites have MBAs they know if they have an MBA from xyz university then they are gonna get hired cause of it. 

What do you guys think, is education after my MS in stats necessary? I mean for me “education” post Masters degree is just reading advanced stats textbooks on my own for fun, whether I need to learn something for work or I’m just studying it for my enjoyment. But is a formal “degree” required? Like I don’t really see the point in me doing a PhD in stats, because I just don’t want to work in an academic setting and frankly I just want money more. 

Is there a natural cap with a MS in something technical (stats) for example?

"Churn prediction: A data imbalance issue, or something else?",1ax45p8,"TLDR: My binary churn prediction model performs way better in development than production. I've listed a few reasons why I think that is, and I'm seeking community help to verify & learn through my mistakes in the process.

Hi! I've been working on a churn model at work. It is to be used to predict once per month, which users will churn in the next 30 days. The model performed much better in development (train/test) compared to initial production run.  
Recall and precision from test: 85%, 85%  
Recall and precision from production month 1: 60%, 18%

I believe the reasons this happened (which I should've realised sooner) is because of the following:

1. The model was trained on historical churn over 2 years (which resulted in a balanced dataset as over a longer period of time many users eventually churn, especially in the industry I'm in) but the inference in production happens on all ""current active users"" *each month* (This is a pretty imbalanced set as roughly 4-5% users churn each month).
2. As the inference happens each month on almost the same user-set (current active users), we might end up making the same prediction as previous month especially if there isn't a huge change in user data since last month. i.e we end up carrying forward false-positives from previous month.
3. Model was only trained on the final states of user-journey. This means I could not include seasonality features as it would leak target data. Why? Because all the non-events (did not churn) ""happen"" on the last month of the training dataset.

Just to add onto point 3, would it have made sense to train model on different points of the user journey instead of just the final state?   
Example:  
data-point 1 :: User 1 features at the end of Jan :: Did not churn  
data-point 2 :: User 1 features at the end of Feb :: Did not churn  
data-point 3 :: User 1 features at the end of March :: **Churned**

As a new grad, can someone clarify just how necessary a masters is and should I start planning to get one now?

Graduating this May with a Bachelors in Applied Math from a top 10 university. Degree has been pretty much the intro math stuff (Calc2&3, Linear Algebra) the 2 first years and Stats/CS/mathematical modeling last 2 years. I have a job lined up already as an L2 analyst at a company I’ve been interning at for the past 2 years. 

I’ve been researching around for more info on just how necessary a masters is in the field and if it’s something I’m going to eventually need to bite the bullet on. Currently, as I understand it, people tend to get caught up in chasing data scientist as a title (which is inherently a senior position) when analyst positions are the more entry level roles. So is it reasonable to assume that analyst for a few years -> DS is a valid path or would I still eventually run into that wall of needing an advanced degree no matter what?

I don’t really want to go through the process of getting a masters. I’m lucky enough to be graduating with no debt and am not really eager to voluntarily get it. The idea of taking 2 years off from making money is not very attractive as well. Also, part of me is just talking as a senior who’s tired of school so there’s that.

Model Selection Help (Student Noob),1awkvza,"Hello everyone,

Not sure if this is the appropriate place to post but I really need some help. I'm in an Intro to DS class and unfortunately, the professor is useless. It's a whole thing - I had to complain to the Dean... anyway. 

I have 3 dataframes: mining, forestation rate, and beef production for 8 countries, from 1990-2020. I want to predict deforestation rates based on the dataframes. As far as I know, I can just split the data into train/test and evaluate the model, I'm not sure if I need actual future predictions but it will not hurt to be on the safe side.  

I have modified the dataframes. I made 8 new DFs - 1 for each country with the mining/beef/deforestation data for that country for the aforementioned years.

We've discussed k-means clustering, SVM, and linear regression models from scikit learn. I have read about VAR on my own. I want something easy to implement (this is intro to ds, afterall) that will be reasonably accurate. We have not worked with time series data in this class. So I have no idea how to adapt the models we've learned about. What i've read about VAR is confusing. 

It doesn't have to be super complicated or fancy. I literally just want a model to make a reasonably decent prediction about forestation rates and how they're affected by mining tand beef production trends for the countries. If I have to, I can probably get away with doing it for 1 country (using the model ok 1 df) and say that it is the most important country to look at because of xyz.

Forecasting a target with a non-datetime index,1awdfzy,"Sorry in advance for the novel lol.

Have a question about TS (or alternatives) for forecasting a target where the ""time"" index is just an ordered integer sequence denoting days since an employee was hired (""tenure days""), and where no data exists yet for the later tenure stages (new process, see notes below).

We are trying to model the average productivity ramp-up period during the first year post-hire for manufacturing workers. For every worker, we have a daily record of the output produced each ""tenure day"", along with running cumulative totals. The cumulative output produced through Day X is our target. We also have predictors such as workplace type (Office/Remote), Team, etc.

For context, when you plot avg total throughput by tenure days,  the curve is approximately logarithmic, e.g. avg lifetime production = ln(tenure).

**Busines Context**: This manufacturing process is new and we only have data through the first 8 months post-hire. Additionally, we have a cohort-style hiring cadence, so not all employees have the same amount of tenure, and our sample sizes decrease as we progress in ""tenure day time""

\**The Ask*: Slead is trying to run a profitability analysis that requires avg expected lifetime throughput through the first 365 days post-hire

**Question**: What are some possible options for forecasting avg expected total throughput for tenure day ""time points"" yet unseen? We don't have any data for months 9-12 as this is a new process and the longest tenured employee has \~8mon tenure.

Linear Regression is underrated,1avoc19,"Hey folks,

Wanted to share a quick story from the trenches of data science. I am not a data scientist but engineer however I've been working on a dynamic pricing project where the client was all in on neural networks to predict product sales and figure out the best prices using overly complicated setup. They tried linear regression once, didn't work magic instantly, so they jumped ship to the neural network, which took them days to train.

I thought, ""Hold on, let's not ditch linear regression just yet."" Gave it another go, dove a bit deeper, and bam - it worked wonders. Not only did it spit out results in seconds (compared to the days of training the neural networks took), but it also gave us clear insights on how different factors were affecting sales. Something the neural network's complexity just couldn't offer as plainly.

Moral of the story? Sometimes the simplest tools are the best for the job. Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees might seem too basic next to flashy neural networks, but it's quick, effective, and gets straight to the point. Plus, you don't need to wait days to see if you're on the right track.

So, before you go all in on the latest and greatest tech, don't forget to give the classics a shot. Sometimes, they're all you need.

Cheers!

Prospects for a (very computational) STEM PhD in FAANG?,1avmzz6,"Hey folks, 

&#x200B;

Last spring I completed a PhD in computational astrophysics - I don't want to go into too much detail as my field is small, but my thesis subject was a monte carlo simulation that I wrote which generated and analyzed many PB of data (yes, I realize that sounds ridiculous - it was ridiculous and it required several supercomputers and a few millions of core hours). The sim was in c++ and most mathematical analysis was written from scratch in c/c++. I'm now about a year into a postdoc which is focused on subject matter very closely related to my thesis work, and also dealing with very large and complex data sets. 

&#x200B;

I have come to realize recently that I'm satisfied with my contributions to science, and I am unsatisfied with how financially far behind I am relative to most people my age (lot of student debt, no retirement, no racecar, etc.).  I'm ready to move on. In addition to my very unique computational and data management/analysis experience, I have some light ML experience and worked for a few years as a SWE for a DoD contractor (prior to grad school). I do not have SQL experience, and my python game is meh but getting better.

&#x200B;

I know FAANG is notoriously hard to break into - anyone here made the transition from hardcore computational STEM to FAANG DS, or any other very high paying DS role? Is it realistic to pursue research based ML roles with only minor past ML experience given my rather unique skills/experience? Any advice on making the transition or skills I should be adding to my resume before I start spamming applications in the coming months?

thanks in advance!

Impostor syndrome - data science without a technical degree,1avaz1u,"I currently work as a Data Scientist at a big bank.

I  graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance), and I actually  got into the role through a rotational program; starting as a Project  Manager for Data Science initiatives but very much with the intention to  learn, build and become technical one day.

I  was frustrated after working on Finance teams in past rotations, only  to find out most of my day was just circling around in Excel and/or  Powerpoint, just didn't feel fulfilling to me at all. I didn't feel like  I was doing anything of substance.

I've  always enjoyed working with data and numbers, originally it was with  data visualization and writing funky Excel formulas, but I knew that I  had to learn to code if I wanted to make this a reality. After great  support and various presentations to my current boss, he (PhD  Engineering) decided to hire me as a full-time Data Scientist, from the  Project Manager role I had before.

He  knows that I am not the most technical, I'm even embarrassed and shy  away from using the title to describe myself. But he has always  commended my ability to learn, my enthusiasm, and ability to grasp  technical concepts and distill them for business/non-technical folks. I  see this advantage in myself as well, not to mention whatever domain  expertise the Commerce degree brings.

Fast  forward a year, I have been fortunate enough to work on some cool  projects, particularly in NLP. I sadly do not feel the same enthusiasm  and rush to learn as I did once, but I feel way more comfortable with  coding. I would still say I have a lot to learn on the technicals, but  from what I understand, most people in DS feel this way.

Layoffs  are getting a bit too close now, and I have been applying viciously -  for DS and DA roles alike. I know I'll be at a disadvantage for DS given  I only have a Bachelor, not to mention it is non-technical. I've even  had someone tell me when I mention my degree, that they ""only hire  engineers"", and ""even their UX designer has a Chemical Enginering  Masters"" (weird flex but ok)

I  guess the point of this post is to see whether I can continue in DS. I  have now a year of experience as a Data Scientist, but I honestly don't  know if I feel worth that. I feel like a data analyst that can code,  with an interest in ML and DL. I don't know if people would even look at  my resume and consider hiring me for DS, or just laugh me out the door.

Not to mention my DS salary is inflated compared to DA roles, which makes my job hunt really tough.

I'm  not sure what to do; I've been told to take a pay cut if I get a role,  or to go back to school for a technical masters, or to still focus only  on DS.

Honestly, I just want to  figure out what I'm worth with one year of DS experience and a  non-technical Bachelors. At this point, I'm just applying to both types  of roles, and seeing what sticks. It would suck to go for a DA role and  lose the ML elements of my work now (feels like a downgrade), but at the  same time, I have no idea if I can continue in this position at a new  company.

TLDR: Joined as a Finance  major, hated working in Finance, with support of an incredible team,  hired as a Data Scientist a year ago. Layoffs season is around the  corner and I'm applying, but not sure if my background will actually get  me anything in DS field. Unsure if I should continue to apply for DS,  or give up and go 'back' to DA, more than anything, feeling a lot of  impostor syndrome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1avaz1u/impostor_syndrome_data_science_without_a/,sg6128,27,Career Discussion,23,New
how do I politely ask the head of the department to cancel the daily meetings routine?,1av80sc,"First, I am adding the great thread from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/y3ty7k/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_daily_standup/) about daily meetings for DS teams.

Daily meetings are used for data scientists to briefly summarize what they did, well, in the last day. As mentioned in the first thread, it should not be longer than 90 sec per person, in some of the companies it is called stand-up meeting and it is done literally while standing in order to make it quick.

However, I still have a few problems with it. Some context - I am a team lead in a mainly remote position.

Our head of the department treats it as a place to mingle and get updated with everyone, that is, a mixture between a professional meeting and a social event. It usually makes this meeting being 25-30 minutes.

It seems that the team members join only because they must. They don't participate in a conversation, they don't exchange ideas, and basically just wait for the meeting to end. My head of the department, on the other side, is a big talker, and usually at the end of the daily starts with a five-seven minutes monologue about what he is going to do, what he did, and usually it is the same stuff that he already went over yesterday.

Moreover, and sorry in advance for my French, it is the first meeting in the morning, so after one has their coffee and would prefer a silent morning/a meeting with the toilet, we have to nod for 30 minutes.

Lastly, and most importantly, things in DS are moving slowly. Not everyday we have things to update about. I have meetings with my team members every two days, which are profound, we brainstorm and derive tasks. This is the place where I track their progress and give them feedback. I don't need to see them every day (unless they need me).

&#x200B;

I would like to ask my manager (head of) to make the daily meetings actually twice/three times a week, and instead, I will brief him myself, on 1on1, even on a daily for just the management.

How do you learn about new analyses to apply to a situation?,1av27da,"**Situation:** 2022, joined a consumer product team in FAANG. 1B+ users.

Eventually came across an article about **daily retention curves** and it opened my mind to a new way to analyze user metrics. Super insightful, and I've been the voice of retention on the team since. 

**Problem:** With analytics and DS, I don't know what I don't know until I learn about it. But I don't have a good model for learning expect for reading a ton online. Analytics, especially statistics, is not always intuitive and finding a new way to look at data can sometimes open your mind.

presenting womp: an FDC-based nutrition calculator,1auunuq,"I made a CLI tool called [womp](https://github.com/ndwarshuis/womp) (what's on my plate) to calculate nutrient data in a meal plan based on the USDA Food Data Central (FDC) database.

The general idea is that one specifies a meal plan using foods in the FDC database (or custom if they don't exist) and `womp` will aggregate and present the results either as a tree (JSON) or table (tsv). Many of the expected operations such as filtering/sorting/grouping/normalizing (by date, time interval, meal type, nutrient etc) are supported natively using CLI flags. If one wants to perform more complex analysis, the output formats lend themselves easily to consumption by more-powerful data analysis workflows based in python/R/etc.

I realize there are already tools such as [cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) and other web apps like [this](https://www.nutritionvalue.org/nutritioncalculator.php) that can perform these functions. However, I wanted a tool that was lightweight, scriptable, and open source. Furthermore, the existing projects I could find on github that presented as ""FDC frontends"" did not meet my needs in terms of functionality or quality.

`womp` more or less does what I need at the moment, so this is mostly a PSA for others who might be interested. I have the bandwith to fix bugs and review PRs, and add small new features. See ""potential future additions"" at the bottom of the readme (many of which are not ""small"" features so I would want help adding if someone actually wants them), or present the case for a new feature not already listed there.

In my opinion, there will be 2 ""safe"" jobs.

One, high level ML engineer in big tech - the people who automate everybody's job - but not the ones in small companies who only do ML for local purposes, they won't be needed once the tools created by big software companies get good enough to easily implement anywhere.

Two, BI analyst - won't need to know how to do the math or programming, rather will be somebody who's an expert in the domain, knows the business needs, understands how to tell a story and what needs to be analyzed. Basically a ""soft skills"" person with power of AI at the click of a button, but still has some tech skills to understand the limitations. Main focus will be to bridge the gap between the AI and the purely business people, visualize, make dashboards, use the automated tools (similar to how BI analysts currently are, but due to the automation might take over some of the tasks that originally required a lot of math/programming and now will be simplified to the difficulty of Excel).

Data science and data analyst jobs (who spend time writing Python code and SQL queries) will imo be severely reduced or transform into BI analyst.

The nutshell: tech jobs are scraped from Indeed, a transformer-based pipeline extracts skills and classifies the jobs, and Power BI presents the visualizations. 

Notable changes from the report I shared a few months back are:

* Skills have a custom fuzzy match to resolve their canonical form
* Years of experience is pulled from each span the skill is found within the posting and calculated
* Pay is extracted and calculated for multiple frequencies (annual, monthly, weekly, etc.)
* Job titles and skills are embedded using the latest OpenAI model (Large) and then clustered
* Skill count and pay percentile (what are the top skills for the job and which skills pay the most)
   * Ordered by highest to lowest in the table
* Apple is hiring a shit ton of AI/ML (translation: the singularity is *nearer*)

The full report is available at my website [hazon.fyi](https://hazon.fyi)

Some things I want to do next:

* NER: Education and certifications
   * Easy to do but boring
* Subcategories: Add subcats to large categories (i.e. Software Engineering > DevOps)
* Assistant API: Build a resume builder that leverages the OpenAI Assistant API
* Observable Framework: Build some decent visuals now that I have a website

Please let me know what you think, critique first.

Where to find groups for colab projects? ,1atuizu,"

Unfortunately, I experienced a layoff in January and I'm currently seeking opportunities to enhance my skills during this transitional period. While exploring various courses, I've noticed that most of them cater to beginners in data science.

Therefore, I'm considering undertaking projects to enrich my portfolio and delve into areas where I have limited experience, such as neural networks. It would be fantastic to connect with individuals facing similar circumstances, enabling us to exchange ideas and collaborate on projects larger than what we could achieve individually.

Should I attempt to do machine learning project without business need,1atk61o,"   
I have an incompetent data science manager and an organization that is very low on data science expertise. They have hired many data scientists and promoted numerous database engineers and analysts to data science roles. Management only wants to hear about how machine learning can save money and refuses to consider the challenges involved. We have a fraud and counterfeit problem. The directive we receive is, ""Hey, data scientists and AI experts, we know machine learning can be used for fraud detection, so save us X millions of dollars using machine learning."" However, when we investigate closely, we find many discrepancies. The only commonality between the types of fraud in our organization and the types of fraud where machine learning is successfully used is the word ""fraud."" The manager either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand. This has been happening for close to three years (even before I joined the company). It's a large organization with data scattered everywhere and many quality issues. We also don't receive many requirements from the business. I'm used to receiving a business requirement and then working with the business to determine if there's a machine learning use case, and then proceeding from there, justifying each step. However, the manager wants us to randomly come up with a use case and then go and talk to stakeholders. Does that ever work in a large organization? Most of the time, we don't even get a reply from them because they are too busy. It's even difficult to determine what is worth working on without involving the business from the beginning. The business is going to be the ultimate entity that implements our solution, so how can we do it without getting buy-in upfront? Do you have any experience navigating this kind of situation? For context, the size of the org is 100,000+ employees.

I manage data scientists and my primary job is to make sure their work can be translated to real business value for our organization.

During my MBA I remember all the Harvard case studies we read and they were really helpful in distilling important concepts in business and how different companies tackled  different problems they were facing.

Is there something like this for data science that’s not a research paper on the latest ML techniques, but rather case studies on how companies have used data science to solve their problems.

Should I just stick to the Harvard business review and try to curate data science case studies?

I like the capabilities of generative machine learning but I'm really overwhelmed and exhausted when almost every article I read, almost every ML project in my company is based on an LLM application. Now that OpenAI's Sora (text to video model) is out, I'm not sure what are its implications in computer vision.

Should I let go of my technical work to grow at my current company?,1asa2by,"I'm at crossroads in my current position.

Identifying patterns in timestamps,1arp1fq,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I have an interesting problem I've not faced before. I have a dataset of timestamps and I need to be able to detect patterns, specifically consistent bursts of timestamp entries. This is the only column I have. I've processed the data and it seems clear that the best way to do this would be to look at the intervals between timestamps.

The challenge I'm facing is knowing what qualifies as a coherent group.

For example, 

""Group 1"": 2 seconds, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 3 seconds

""Group 2"": 2 seconds, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 3 seconds

""Group 3"": 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 3 seconds, 2 seconds

""Group 4"": 2 seconds, 2 seconds, 1 second, 3 seconds, 2 seconds

&#x200B;

So, it's clear Group 1 & Group 2 are essentially the same thing but: is group 3 the same? (I think so). Is group 4 the same? (I think so). But maybe I can say group 1 & group 2 are really a part of a bigger group, and group 3 and group 4 another bigger group. I'm not sure how to recognize those.

&#x200B;

I would be grateful for any pointers on how I can analyze that.

1. Train model on training data
2. Rank all of the absolute errors between the model prediction and the actuals for a VALIDATION set
3. Say we want 95% prediction interval
4. Choose the absolute error value such that 95% of absolute errors are less than or equal to that amount. Say this value is 1.5 for simplicity
5. Now when I predict on a test set, should I just add 1.5 and subtract 1.5 to each point prediction to create my 95% prediction interval?

A harsh truth about data science....,1arg0lv,"Broadly speaking, the job of a data scientist is to use data to understand things, create value, and inform business decisions. It it *not necessarily* to implement and utilize advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. That's not to say that you can't or won't use ML/AI to inform business decisions, what I'm saying is that it's not always required to. Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.

I think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away. They apply them anywhere they can, kind of shoehorning them in and not having a clear idea of what it is they are even trying to accomplish in the first place. In other words, the tools lead the problem. Of course, the way it should be is that the problem leads the tools. I'm coming to find for like 50+% of the things I'm asked to do, a time series visualization, contingency tables, and histograms are sufficient to answer the question to the satisfaction of the business leaders. That's it. We're done, on to the next one. Start simple, if the simple techniques don't answer the question, then move on to the more advanced stuff. I speak from experience, of course.

In my opinion, understanding when to use simple tools vs when to break out the big guns is way harder then figuring out how to use the big guns. Even harder still is taking your findings and translating them into actual, actionable insights that a business can use. Okay, so you built a multi-layer CNN that models customer behavior? That's great, but what does the business do with it? For example, can you use it to identify customers who might buy more product with more advertising? Can you put a list of those customers on the CEO's desk? Could a simple regression model have done the same in 1/4 of the time? These are skills that take years to learn and so it's totally understandable for newer or prospective DSs to not have them. But they do not seem to be emphasized in a lot of degree programs or MOOCs. It seems to me like they just hand you a dataset and tell you what to do with it. It's great that you can use the tools they tell you to on it, but you're missing out on the identifying which tools to even use part in the first place.

Would you agree? Focusing on mastering math is the best RoI for long-term satisfaction,1aq6sxh,"First of all, this is from the perspective of an analyst who is more on the business side, so let me know if I'm completely stupid.

Why I'm writing this - I think many people underestimate the basic ""boring"" math and they just go right to how neural networks function or how to use logistic regression

Algorithms keep changing, libraries keep changing, domain related knowledge will (partially) change as your economy sector evolves and you'll pick it up as you go anyway...

Even whatever university degree you pick is kind of arbitrary, some of them might make learning math easier for you, but you can always pick it up yourself - even if you study something seemingly unrelated, if you're smart enough for data science you can self-study math

If you're worried about long-term job prospects and satisfaction, it seems to me you should focus on making your main goal to master all possible areas of math. Even the ones directly unrelated to your work. Because data science (and tech in general) is a lifelong study and you will keep having to learn new stuff all the time.

But if you know the fundamental math behind it all, it will make it much easier to learn new algorithms for example. It will also be easier to pick up the logic behind certain principles within your domain, as you'll get better intuition. Part of this should be learning logic (whether you count this as math or philosophy is up to debate).

I am just thinking out loud and kind of looking for confirmation bias, because I've been learning all the juicy ML algorithms and libraries, programming languages etc in the past few years. And I'm thinking I should have just focused on getting better at statistics, probability, combinatorics, discrete math in general... linear algebra... calculus... hell, even if you go all the way back to elementary school or high school, there are surely some topics you forgot and they might be useful to re-learn (like some stuff from geometry that you NEVER used but it could be the missing piece from understanding some stuff you're working on now).

Because all the stuff I learned a few years ago is already obsolete anyway. But math is unchanged for hundreds and thousands of years. And still useful.

So recently I've more shifted to the theoretical side of things. And it's made me happier with problem solving and I have less impostor syndrome. All kinds of different word problems are good practice especially.

tldr: Instead of learning 50 ways to do similar things, learning the underlying math - not superficially, but all the way to the fundamentals, even all the way to elementary school if you forgot something - should be better for long-term.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1aq6sxh/would_you_agree_focusing_on_mastering_math_is_the/,JabClotVanDamn,170,Discussion,118,New

Do you use automated alerting in your job?,1aph771,"# Question

What tools exist today for automated alerting? Do you use them in your core job? Wondering if there have been advances in the space in the last few years? If you do use them then what business function are you running them for.

# My past experience 

My team and I built an internal tool for alerting (called Cassandra) in 2016. A business user specified the metric they would like to track and we automatically identified anomalous changes across dimensions then emailed them when it fell outside the range. They could then dig in further in our interactive dashboard. It failed as we were not precise enough with our alerting and consumers ultimately lost interest in our alerts and began to treat them as spam.

Is it even worth it for me to try to learn new data science methodologies and techniques at this point?,1apf2gc,"I got my MS in stats in 2020 and had about 3.5 years experience as a data analyst at that time. I wanted to break into data science, and so it being lock down and nothing else for me to do, I started teaching myself the cutting edge of the field at the time, things like neural nets and a bunch of advanced ML techniques. I did several projects on my own (no, not just titanic and mnist datasets) and created an online public portfolio. I applied to tons of data science jobs but had no luck. I've been able to increase my salary through a progression of analyst jobs, but none of them really use anything advanced. The one I was at before had a little tiny bit of clustering and FA, and maybe a basic regression model, the one I'm at now is literally all just SQL dashboarding. 

After my first move in Feb '21, I kind of just stopped trying to stay on top of the field, since I got a higher salary and I just kind of burnt out of doing so much stuff on my own to try and make myself more marketable. I just did other things with my life for a few years, but I'm feeling ready for another move now. I notice now data science positions are asking for AI, GPT4, LlaMa, and those things weren't around when I was really working on my skills. I'm willing to learn those things if there's a good chance I'll use them, but I haven't used tensorflow, keras, or sklearn at all despite sinking massive amounts of my personal time into them.

I think part of it is there seem to be no junior level data scientist roles. It seems at most places, analyst is a different career path that tops out at management instead of more advanced methodologies, and so it doesn't really get me any closer to data scientist. Most open DS positions I see are senior or even manager and so I'm nowhere near qualified for them. I'm questioning if it's even worth it for me to spend so much time trying to learn these things when the DS positions are forever out of reach, and perhaps I'm better off getting an MBA or something and trying to target leadership analyst type roles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1apf2gc/is_it_even_worth_it_for_me_to_try_to_learn_new/,son_of_tv_c,78,Career Discussion,62,New

In drug development, where the median clinical trial costs about $48 million, biotech companies face the major challenge of balancing expenses with the need for robust, well-designed, and sufficiently large clinical trials. This reality has motivated software companies like Unlearn.AI to pioneer machine learning (ML) applications to boost clinical trial efficiency. Yet, implementing such cutting-edge methodology is not without significant practical challenges.

Today's post delves into the merits and limitations of Unlearn's ML-based Prognostic Covariate Adjustment (PROCOVA). I argue that the theoretical cost-savings of PROCOVA are unlikely to be realized in practice. Given the often high stakes of clinical trials, the risk of adopting innovative ML-based methodologies may not be worth the purported benefits.

A Common Misconception About Cross Entropy Loss,1aodk18,"**Cross Entropy Loss for multi class classification, when the last layer is Softmax**

The misconception is that the network *only* learns from its prediction on the correct class

It is common online to see comments [like this one](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/20301/159699), that, while technically true, obfuscate the understanding of how a neural network updates its parameters after training on a single sample in multi-class classification. Other comments, [such as this one](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/31966/159699), [and this one](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/20296/cross-entropy-loss-explanation/24696#comment91209_24696), are flat out wrong. This makes studying this topic especially confusing, so I wanted to clear some things up.

# The Common Misconception

>The Cross Entropy Loss function for a single sample can be written as 𝐿 = − **𝐲 ⋅** log( **𝐲̂** ) . Therefore the Loss is only dependent on the active class in the y-vector, because that will be the only nonzero term after the dot product.^((This part is true))  
>  
>Therefore the neural network only learns from its prediction on the correct class

**That is not true!**

Minimizing the loss function is the objective, but the learning is performed with the gradient of the loss function. More specifically, the parameter updates are given by the learning rate times the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. Even though the Loss function will not change based on the predicted probabilities for the incorrect classes, its gradient does depend on those values.

I can't really write equations here, but from *Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Charu C. Aggarwal*, the gradient for a **single layer network** (multinomial logistic regression)​ is given by

∂L/∂W = {

for the correct class: -Xi ( 1 - ŷ )

for the incorrect class: Xi ŷ

}

or in matrix form:  ∂L/∂W = - Xi (y - ŷ)^(T)

So the gradient will be a matrix the same shape as the weight matrix.

So we can see that the model is penalized for:

1. Predicting a small probability for the correct class
2. Predicting a large probability for the incorrect class

&#x200B;

**Generalizing to a multilayer network**

The gradient from a single training sample back propagates through each of the prediction neurons, to the specific weight vector pertaining to that neuron in the last weight matrix, as that is its only dependence. The overall weight matrix has k such vectors, for each of the classes. As the gradient back propagates further back into the network, the gradient on a singular weight element will be a sum of the k gradients originating at the prediction neurons.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1aodk18/a_common_misconception_about_cross_entropy_loss/,Toasty_toaster,27,ML,8,New

How do you think AI will change data science (V2),1anxoug,"Hey all, humbled by my last post where I raised ideas for the impact AI may have on data science. I took a lot away from the thread and i want to try again with a fresh take which incorporates the feedback and discussion from the last one. Let me know if you guys think this is closer to the mark and where you agree/disagree. 

**How might AI change Data Science?**

* **AI tools need to work for Data Scientists first and foremost.** AI is not going to turn anyone into a Data Scientist magically overnight. Data professionals are ultimately the ones who will be analyzing the data and telling the story so the tools need to work for them. If the community and user base does not adopt a tool then it will never get traction. 
* **AI may provide productivity benefits for analysis but the data professional will still need to be in the driving seat.** There is a wide variety of different directions that an analysis can go and expecting it all to be automated is not realistic. Only if an AI tool can make someone more productive while still providing flexibility will it be adopted and useful. Github Copilot is a good example of this. 
* **Reducing the barrier to data access will result in more analysis and more data scientists, not less.** If the tools are successful at increasing productivity then we'll have more deeper analysis, and deeper analysis. As people suggested, this is similar to what happened when spreadsheets came on the scene, it did not automate away analysis jobs, instead the amount of analysis went up. 
* **Converting insights from analyses into more consumable formats (like email, slides, docs) should get easier with Gen AI.** Once the insights are available we should hopefully be able to publish in a bunch of different formats. This is still to be proved but appears to be one of the early value props of GenAI. 

Footnote about me: I love working with data. It's been the single thing that has helped me stand out in my 10+ year career in FAANG. I've started as business analyst then data scientist then data engineering then moved to a PM role on a data product. Now I'm consumer PM and guess what, data is how I figure out what is right to build for my product and what sets me apart.

Tech vs Non-Tech route,1annmj8,"Tech Vs Non-Tech route

I'm a data scientist, MLE with ~6 YOE having always worked for product-tech companies which I absolutely love. Was recently laid off from one of the biggest product company in my country (not US). After taking some time off to heal I'm in the job market looking out for my next stint and what I'm noticing is due to the funding winter there's not a lot of open positions at product companies. Although a lot of non-tech companies are still actively hiring.

Now I've an offer from a product company, which happens to be in the same industry as my last company. They have a well structured, lean team where I know I'll learn a lot. but they're low balling me and giving me around 30% hike. On the other hand, I'm in talks with non-tech companies (insurance, pharma, consultancies, etc.) who are willing to give me 70-100% hike. Most of these folks are just getting started and don't have a well structured ML/DS team.

So, to the people of this sub who have probably been through this phase, what would be the ideal  route at this stage in one's career.

Indexing and Extraction Problem,1anjs1h,"Need advice on a couple of things I am working. 

Without going into details my employer has a tool which is used for indexing mortgage documents into certain categories(type of documents) and extracting some entities from this documents.

Now some underliers of their current solution:
1. Documents are received in format of tif/pdf. OCR of a 3rd party is run to convert them into text. 
2. The documents are then being indexed by using direct communication with database using Python. There is no ML model here but a header logic where the names of the documents against the OCR texts are stored in a table and communicated. Also a jaccard logic where sometimes documents have no header names but a similarity comparison logic against the information in the database. 
(This works about 90% of the time but is very slow because of db communication). 
3. For extraction of entities there is no ML logic but regex queries in .NET. As a result most of the information gets missed and about 10% - 15% of information is extracted. 

Now obviously management is looking for some better time management and output. 

The solution I have implemented:
1. Taking the indexing logic in a SVM model. Getting the desired output for indexing in a very minimal time rate. 
2. For extraction I am looking at spaCy EntityRecognizer. I am annotating using doccano and then using arcgis spacy NER for the training. 

Now my question, is have you guys used spaCy EntityRecognizer in a similar manner for a project? And how has the accuracy, precision, recall been?

Advice for a New Data Scientist Struggling with Criticism,1an0kee,"As a relatively new data scientist, I need some frank advice. 

I recently switched from a more traditional software engineer role to a more data focused role. I'd describe myself as an exceptional data engineer, and an average, but enthusiastically improving data scientist. To that end, I'm also in school working through a graduate program in data science (50% done). 

My issue is that the better I get (at least on paper), the more people seem to criticize my analysis. There's many analysts at my office, but very few legitimate data science positions and I've had more than one good friend tell me that my analysis was too hard to understand. This always hits hard because I work very hard to be fair, honest, and understandable.

I honestly don't know if I'm being needlessly complex (to show off), if I'm bad at explaining my analysis, or if I'm just talking in the wrong way to the wrong people. I will say that it absolutely could be an ego issue because I do often feel a strong need to differentiate myself from the growing BI community. 

Is this a common feeling/experience for new data scientists?  For those of you that are more experienced, when you are asked to analyze data for general consumption (for non engineers), do you dumb everything down and leave out the checks and validation that give you confidence in your answers? 

If you are curious, this is probably a [decently representative project that I did for school](https://default.qc0qma7a4qq1g.us-east-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/results). This was peer reviewed, so I assumed very little knowledge in the domain or in data science.

Career Question,1am6ly3,"Hello,

I'm an electrical & control system engineer with 9 YOE in the energy industry (power distribution, natural gas, and Oil & Gas; mostly capital projects).

I've done some data analysis and database work at my work (control system related) but my main responsibility is electrical and control systems (not related to data science).

I'm in MS in DS currently with CS undergrad. My goal is to acquire a DS role in the energy industry related to trading during/after my MS.

&#x200B;

I have a chance to work as an Associate Research Data Analyst position at a school district.

I'm not sure if this will be beneficial for my goal since it's not related to energy field directly.

On the other hand, I'll be doing data analytics and statistics as my primary responsibility.

Pay will be a little less (-20k) than what I'm making now since it'll be an entry level role (I'm considered a senior at my current role and it can be very stressful but still chill for the most part).

&#x200B;

Would it be hard for me to get a job at an utility company as a data scientist if I switch my industry?

Based on my course of study, domain knowledge/expertise really helps with EDA, data engineering, model building, and hyperparameter tuning. Without that it takes a long time even to understand the context of data or how the data should be treated (imputation & feature engineering/selection).

Thanks for the love guys. I am trying to reply as fast as I can to the DMs. But since I found a few FAQs,  I will list them out here.

2. I have not done any masters.
3. There are lots of moving parts to getting a job. Since I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, I can't provide any new tips/tricks that you probably haven't seen reels/videos/articles of.
4. Scoring an interview has a different skillset from cracking the interview. The former is mostly non-technical, the latter being extremely technical.
5. If you have anything specific area I can assist with, I am more than happy to help if I can.
6. Again, I must request you to not ask me for guidance without being specific - I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, so me repeating the same advice won't work. For e.g. a specific question might be  - ""*Is DSA necessary to learn*?"" Then no, I have neither studied DSA nor have been asked in any of my 30+ interviews I have given. However, it's not a thumb rule that you might not be asked.

How does model monitoring work in a proper tech company?,1alwf27,"I might join a proper tech company soon. They’re big on monitoring models and engineering as well

Other than tracking distributional shifts in the features, how does model monitoring work for classifiers and regressors? 

I ask because in order to know a model is performing worse, you need new labels right? Like how would I know the precision or AUC ROC or AUC PR or RMSE is declining for a model in production unless new labels are in the pipeline and the model runs inference on newly labeled data?

Is it generally the case that models are built in areas where you can in fact get some sort of automated and periodically new set of labels?

When I interned at big tech, we labeled a certain search query as type A because the user clicked through and clicked a button that is a strong signal for type A actions. Basically we had a decent signal to label some queries in a somewhat automated way. Not all queries that were Type A were followed through with that button click though. Which is why I guess we built a model to try to generalize queries into Type A or not, even when no button clicking followed — we just had a set of queries where we were confident represented the positive class and marked everything else as not Type A

Any help here on how people generally label data and think about model monitoring in classical ML would be greatly appreciated",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1alwf27/how_does_model_monitoring_work_in_a_proper_tech/,None,43,Discussion,22,New

Best way to deal with contextual and time based telemetry data in a database and then powerbi,1altd2d,"  

I am trying to develop powerbi dashboards for a batch process with multiple steps. Each step, lets call them, step1, step2, step3 and step4 has a start time and end time and context such as the name of the batch in each step. During each step telemetry data is collected. The number of tags from which data points collected in each step differs for each step from 1 to about 20. So let's assume there are 5, 2, 7, and 10 for step1, step2, step3 and step4 respectively. The telemetry data is collected roughly every 5 seconds for each tag in each step.

The data I currently have is organized with the context for each step collected into 4 separate dataframes. The telemetry data is organized as 3 columns for each step. The columns are tag, time and value. Since, for example, step4 has 10 tags collected every 5 seconds in 1 day there should be 172,800 rows of data. The number of rows in the telemetry files for the other steps will vary according to their number of tags.

All data is collected into separate files and I looking to put it into a database with the ultimate goal to connect the telemetry from step1 --> step2 --> step3 --> step4 using the batch name contained within the context of each step and the start and stop times of each step.

The telemetry values for step1 would be collected using step1.telemetry\_time=> step1.start\_time and step1.telemetry\_time <= step1.stop\_time. This method would apply the same to all steps.

The output of the analysis will be powerbi where the data can be analyzed.

My question is what is the best way to organize the data in a database and what database should I use. The data is in Azure. I am currently planning to use SQL for the contextual data, but wasn't sure if was also best to locate the time based data there too. I have read all sorts of comments on the best way to store time based data, but wasn't sure how to apply it to my situation given there might be 2 databases.

"How complex ARE your models in Industry, really? (Imposter Syndrome)",1akjw7t,"Perhaps some imposter syndrome, or perhaps not...**basically--how complex ARE your models, realistically, for industry purposes?** 

""Industry Purposes"" in the sense of answering business questions, such as:

* Build me a model that can predict whether a free user is going to convert to a paid user. (Prediction)
* Here's data from our experiment on Button A vs. Button B, which Button should we use? (Inference)
* Based on our data from clicks on our website, should we market towards Demographic A? (Inference)

I guess inherently I'm approaching this scenario from a prediction or inference perspective, and not from like a ""building for GenAI or Computer Vision"" perspective.

------------------

I know (and have experienced) that a lot of the work in Data Science is prepping and cleaning the data, but I always feel a little imposter syndrome when I spend the bulk of my time doing that, and then throw the data into a package that creates like a ""black-box"" Random Forest model that spits out the model we ultimately use or deploy.

Sure, along the way I spend time tweaking the model parameters (for a Random Forest example--tuning # of trees or depth) and checking my train/test splits, communicating with stakeholders, gaining more domain knowledge, etc., but ""creating the model"" once the data is cleaned to a reasonable degree is just loading things into a package and letting it do the rest. Feels a little too simple and cheap in some respects...especially for the salaries commanded as you go up the chain.

And since a lot of money is at stake based on the model performance, it's always a little nerve-wracking to hinge yourself on some black-box model that performed well on your train/test data and ""hope"" it generalizes to unseen data and makes the company some money.

Definitely much less stressful when it's just projects for academics or hypotheticals where there's no real-world repercussions...there's always that voice in the back of my head saying ""surely, something as simple as this needs to be improved for the company to deem it worth investing so much time/money/etc. into, right?""

------------------

Anyone else feel this way? Normal feeling--get used to it over time? Or is it that the more experience you gain, the bulk of ""what you are paid for"" isn't necessarily developing complex or novel algorithms for a business question, but rather how you communicate with stakeholders and deal with data-related issues, or similar stuff like that...?

------------------

**EDIT: Some good discussion about what types of models people use on a daily basis for work, but beyond saying ""I use Random Forest/XGBoost/etc."", do you incorporate more complexity besides the ""simple"" pipeline of: Clean Data -> Import into Package and do basic Train/Test + Hyperparameter Tuning + etc., -> Output Model for Use?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1akjw7t/how_complex_are_your_models_in_industry_really/,Joe10112,200,Discussion,152,New

PM internship as a data science student ?,1aiksqs,"Sorry in advance for this being the n-th whiny post about the job market.

I'm an MSc Data Science student currently struggling finding an (unpaid) internship in the field.

I don't have working experience in data related jobs yet and when I apply for unpaid intern position (Europe) I always get, if any, answers such as ""we are looking for candidates with more experience"".

I understand that but really ? Are there experienced applicants who are willing to work unpaid as interns ? How am I supposed to even start this career if even the most basic entry position is impossbile to get due to better qualified applicants ?

I'm applying to everything data related: BI, DA, DS.

Now, recently I noticed a position as a project manager intern in a data driven company I really like. The position do require data related tasks but I'm yet to have an interview with them so I don't really know.

Would it make sense, if I want to pursue a career as a DS, to accept an internship in the PMO ? While I wouldn't get much data related experience, it would be an occasion to dip my feet in the job market and build some network.

The company I'm talking about also opens DS internship positions from time to time but is closed atm. Should I wait for the DS position to open risking to fight with hundreds of other applicants ? Will a PM experience improve my chances of landing a data related job (both in the same company and in others) ?

I love data and I would even sell my ass to a beautician internship if that would somehow increase my chances of landing a DA/BI/DS job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1aiksqs/pm_internship_as_a_data_science_student/,ComedianImpressive37,3,Career Discussion,16,New
Visualizing What Batch Normalization Is and Its Advantages,1aihddg," Optimizing your neural network training with Batch Normalization 

[Visualizing What Batch Normalization Is and Its Advantages](https://preview.redd.it/dah6fe3kgigc1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f8a08ae05cf2989d109ae274b6f65e5cc83002)

# Introduction

 Have you, when conducting deep learning projects, ever encountered a situation where the more layers your neural network has, the slower the training becomes? 

 If your answer is YES, then congratulations, it's time for you to consider using batch normalization now. 

# What is Batch Normalization?

 As the name suggests, batch normalization is a technique where batched training data, after activation in the current layer and before moving to the next layer, is standardized. Here's how it works: 

1. *The entire dataset is randomly divided into N batches without replacement, each with a mini\_batch size, for the training.*
2. *For the i-th batch, standardize the data distribution within the batch using the formula:* *(Xi - Xmean) / Xstd**.*
3. *Scale and shift the standardized data with* *γXi + β* *to allow the neural network to undo the effects of standardization if needed.*

 The steps seem simple, don't they? So, what are the advantages of batch normalization? 

# Advantages of Batch Normalization

### Speeds up model convergence

 Neural networks commonly adjust parameters using gradient descent. If the cost function is smooth and has only one lowest point, the parameters will converge quickly along the gradient. 

 But if there's a significant variance in the data distribution across nodes, the cost function becomes less like a pit bottom and more like a valley, making the convergence of the gradient exceptionally slow. 

 Confused? No worries, let's explain this situation with a visual: 

 First, prepare a virtual dataset with only two features, where the distribution of features is vastly different, along with a target function: 

    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
    
    A = rng.uniform(1, 10, 100)
    B = rng.uniform(1, 200, 100)
    
    y = 2*A + 3*B + rng.normal(size=100) * 0.1  # with a little bias

 Then, with the help of GPT, we use matplot3d to visualize the gradient descent situation before data standardization: 

[ Visualization of cost functions without standardization of data.  ](https://preview.redd.it/s7zorqm9higc1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=f92388f9e3384eee96ce2585b7bc70f25392cee9)

 Notice anything? Because one feature's span is too large, the function's gradient is stretched long in the direction of this feature, creating a valley. 

 Now, for the gradient to reach the bottom of the cost function, it has to go through many more iterations. 

 But what if we standardize the two features first? 

    def normalize(X):
        mean = np.mean(X)
        std = np.std(X)
        return (X - mean)/std
    
    A = normalize(A)
    B = normalize(B)

 Let's look at the cost function after data standardization: 

[ Visualization of standardized cost functions for data. ](https://preview.redd.it/5ou0awyehigc1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c3f4dd14b78d52f0fe1396a0c131d19e0f6aea)

 Clearly, the function turns into the shape of a bowl. The gradient simply needs to descend along the slope to reach the bottom. Isn't that much faster? 

### Slows down the problem of gradient vanishing

 The graph we just used has already demonstrated this advantage, but let's take a closer look. 

 Remember this function? 

[ Visualization of sigmoid function.  ](https://preview.redd.it/jl3cyhojhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c2e2047317d99d89b9232b37fa28652eb10f7bd)

 Yes, that's the sigmoid function, which many neural networks use as an activation function. 

 Looking closely at the sigmoid function, we find that the slope is steepest between -2 and 2. 

[ The slope of the sigmoid function is steepest between -2 and 2. ](https://preview.redd.it/j6l02trmhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=504efbe5562e9b477a4c48e943011dca7bab5fa7)

 If we reduce the standardized data to a straight line, we'll find that these data are distributed exactly within the steepest slope of the sigmoid. At this point, we can consider the gradient to be descending the fastest. 

[ The normalized data will be distributed in the steepest interval of the sigmoid function. ](https://preview.redd.it/kk0mrflphigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=43d1dbc9b1a63952a41730146bfd624db97b2b4d)

 However, as the network goes deeper, the activated data will drift layer by layer (Internal Covariate Shift), and a large amount of data will be distributed away from the zero point, where the slope gradually flattens. 

[ The distribution of data is progressively shifted within the neural network. ](https://preview.redd.it/6y088bkthigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ebded75578b8a0daad7874d3803b926db74363)

 At this point, the gradient descent becomes slower and slower, which is why with more neural network layers, the convergence becomes slower. 

 If we standardize the data of the mini\_batch again after each layer's activation, the data for the current layer will return to the steeper slope area, and the problem of gradient vanishing can be greatly alleviated. 

[ The renormalized data return to the region with the steepest slope.  ](https://preview.redd.it/pmkgqpuwhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ce3916984707d86f314a3dc458f403b0584999)

### Has a regularizing effect

 If we don't batch the training and standardize the entire dataset directly, the data distribution would look like the following: 

[ Distribution after normalizing the entire data set. ](https://preview.redd.it/a0nuru70iigc1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bd763b5d450599cb6527089e01b0a1735aac4cb)

 However since we divide the data into several batches and standardize the data according to the distribution within each batch, the data distribution will be slightly different. 

[ Distribution of data sets after normalization by batch. ](https://preview.redd.it/of8wlwc2iigc1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ad7cf81a7c08512399e7681ff3bce8568d11e7)

 You can see that the data distribution has some minor noise, similar to the noise introduced by Dropout, thus providing a certain level of regularization for the neural network. 

## Conclusion

 Batch normalization is a technique that standardizes the data from different batches to accelerate the training of neural networks. It has the following advantages: 

* Speeds up model convergence.
* Slows down the problem of gradient vanishing.
* Has a regularizing effect.

Back in May I graduated with an MSDS (straight out of undergrad so no full-time work experience prior). Currently putting in my time as a data analyst until I move to a role where I can do some more high powered data stuff. It’s looking like I’ll have the opportunity to at least in part shape the work I do more as some of the big projects I was hired on for are wrapping up (and I made a good impression I think), and I’ve been thinking about what skills I want to start trying to build.

Geospatial was a bit of a theme in my education, taking a GIS class in undergrad and my DS master’s capstone was also geospatial ML. It’s something I’ve enjoyed and wondering if it can be a thread I follow further into my career. Are their specialist DS’s in geospatial? Does anyone here have this type of experience or has worked with people who have? What industries do the work in and what tools do they use?

How to get real life experience as a newly graduate?,1ai2rcq,"I graduated from a top London university about 6 months ago with Computer Science (2:1). It was a great learning journey for me and I realised ed my passion for data science. It is what I want to do for a career and what u feel drawn to. In my second year sadly my mother passed away and I had to interrupt for a year to help me cope. I started as a front end developer intern in a mid-size company, not my dream job but it taught me how to work in a team, scrum/agile, git and all other essentials. I finished my final year and I realised that I didn’t want to look into software engineering positions like everyone else from my course.

 My problem now is that I don’t have the required experience to land an entry level job. I started another course all about DS and I try to apply my skills in practice so I can showcase projects. Unfortunately that also doesn’t seem to be enough, as recruiters want work experience, so I feel like I’m going in circles. I’d love to start a MS in DS but right now I really can’t afford it. I feel really low as I am stuck in a minimum wage job part time, to help me cope with bills, but I know I have the skills to do so much more. I must be doing something wrong but I don’t know where to start from.

How to Approach Customer Prediction,1ahqy80,"This is probably a well known problem, but it's my first time and would like some guidance.

My goal is to determine which new users are going to be new investors in the near future (let's call this a conversion). And provide a daily probability of conversion to each new user who has not become an investor yet. Once I have those predicted probabilities. I can send vouchers to new users who are 'on the fence' and ignore those who have a 90% conversion probability.

Case 1:
 If a new user signs up today and converts immediately, I have very little features about them. Perhaps only time to verify email, phone model, location.

Case 2:
If they sign up today, and they read the blog, log in everyday for a week, setup their profile, fill in their bank details, and become an investor in 10 days. Then I know a lot about them, and can make more accurate predictions.

My solution is to run a classification with conversion 1/0. And do a ranking by pred proba. But what should be my reference time when querying the features? 

- Should it be 1 day before conversion? 

If someone signed up 10 years ago and they converted on day 4. The data will show they have a tenure of 3 days, and signed up 10 years ago. The model will figure out it's an investor. (Data leakage)

Also non-investors never converted, so what do i do here?

- Should it be 10 days after signup?
A lot of users invested on day 5. I would have to ignore these people.

- Should I query data with multiple reference points? Day 1 through 30? 
Problem here is day 1 will be over represented.

Is this a time series problem? If so, would appreciate any resources on how to tackle this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1ahqy80/how_to_approach_customer_prediction/,tootieloolie,17,Discussion,12,New

Has anybody played with Astrological sign as a feature?,1ahj1gj,"Now that I've got your attention.

Astrology, while largely a pseudoscience that appeals to non data minded folk, is largely about identifying trends and presenting them in a human readable (albeit unscientific) format.

While it's unlikely that the placement of the stars and planets themselves have a significant impact on the trajectory of an individual, the placing of their birthdate within the year (which I suppose is in relation to the sun) probably has an impact on how they develop and find their way within society.

For example, someone born in August tends to start school almost a year earlier in their development than an individual born in September. From there the August child will always be amongst the youngest in their class whereas the September child is grouped with the oldest. This has cascading effects throughout childhood development that will leave drastically different imprints upon both children and create different adult life paths.

Business wants to measure the impact of this test on downstream KPI: In this case it’s the conversion rate (how many people land on order confirmation page).

How would you approach this problem? or, are there resources that provide examples of tests that happen upstream and you wish to measure downstream impact.

During the EDA, I'm focusing on regression analysis for feature importance. Meanwhile, I've assigned a junior engineer to cluster the data based on feature characteristics.

Which path is better: Data Science or Software Engineering?,1adt52s,"Okay, so I'm in need of some career advice, because honestly I'm at a point where I don't really know how to proceed in the future.

For some background info:
- I've completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (3 years degree), took a year of pause (during that time I just focused on work), and at the moment I'm in my first year (out of 2) of my Masters's degree in Data Science.

- As for work experience, I started working during my second year of Bachelor's as a Software Engineer. I've completed two internships, and I've been a Junior Software Engineer for more than a year and a half (currently I'm still working, trying to manage both my job and the university lectures and assignments in parallel). The languages/frameworks that I've worked with the most are Python - Django/FatsAPI, Ruby - Ruby on Rails, TypeScript - React (even if my perspective for this field is that I shouldn't be fixed on just some languages/standards, as the industry is evolving at such a rate, that from a month to the other we might find a new tool that's 100 times more efficient).

- Up until recently I didn't ever interact that much with the concepts of Machine Learning, but since starting the Data Science degree I've realised that I like this field a lot and I take every Uni project as a challenge that I love solving.

Now let's get to the actual issue at hand: in the next few months I would like to look for another workplace, since I've realized that the environment that I'm currently in is affecting me negatively and unfortunately I don't consider that this is a place where I can grow (both as an employee/software engineer as well as a person in general). If you'd like more info about the reasons, I can edit this post and add them, but I don't want to make this too long.

At this point, I don't really know what path to take: continue with the Software Engineering career or switch to Data Science / ML / NLP?

I'm asking this from 2 distinct perspectives:
1. which one of the two is better for my future? I've been reading different posts lately about some data scientists / ml engineers saying that this field is really volatile and a lot of companies switch strategies from one day to another and many find themselves unemployed out of the blue, besides the fact that some people say that there are already too many data scientists / ml engineers for the few jobs required. But thinking about all of the advances in AI that have been happening lately, I was under the impression that this field is going to thrive in the future.
2. I have always believed that salaries in both fields are good, but as a data scientist / ml engineer you can reach a higher max salary compared to what the max salary of a software engineer can be (even if I've also read posts that stated the contrary).

If I want to be completely honest, I think that I already have the answer, since I like a lot what I'm studying and everything related to this field is just sooo captivating. 

But my problem right now is that I've ve been able to get to a point where I'm competent enough as a software engineer to make enough money to support myself, so finding another job in the same field would be easier. Since my parents are not helping me financially anymore, I don't think I would be able to get by with the paycheck of an intern (around 800 Euros/month where I live), if I were to switch fields.
And I don't think anyone would take me in this field for anything more than an internship, because I'm aware of the fact that I do not have enough experience in Machine Learning and Statistics for any other role.

As for some additional information that might be helpful, I'm in my early twenties and I live in Eastern Europe, where prices are not as high as in other places, but it's still not easy to get by by yourself.
I've been also looking around for various opportunities in other countries in this field, in order to be able to work remotely or maybe do an internship there, but I haven't been able to find much.

PS: I know that a lot of people might say that I'm young and that this is the best time to take risks, but going to an intern's salary would just expose me to the risk of being homeless, and that's not such a good option :D

PS 2.0: I have also mentioned the NLP sector because it sparked my interest and I’ve been taking some extra classes in order to gain some more knowledge about it.

TLDR: which is the best career option between Software Engineering and Data Science/ML/NLP?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1adt52s/which_path_is_better_data_science_or_software/,some_username0,124,Career Discussion,146,New

Becoming a Data Scientist from ME,1ad6q50,"
I graduated with a BS in ME about 2 years and I am kind of finding out that it's not for me.

My first question is Data Science really what I should be going for? In my research this what I want to become I can really focus on making data mean something and drawing conclusions but are there any big things I am missing? I am thinking of going and getting my Masters. I saw bootcamps and I think I want a real degree as I hope the alumni connections can get me in.

"UPDATE #2: I built an app to make my job search a little more sane, and I thought others might like it too! No ads, no recruiter spam, etc.",1ad5lxa,"Hey again everyone!

&#x200B;

We've made a lot of progress on [zen](https://zensearch.jobs/) in the past few months, so I'll drop a couple of the most important things / highlights about the app here:

* Zen is still a candidate / seeker-first job board. This means we have no ads, we have no promoted jobs from companies who are paying us, we have no recruiters, etc. The whole point of Zen is to help you find jobs quickly at companies you're interested in without any headaches.
* On that point, we'll send you emails notifying you when companies you care about post new jobs that match your preferences, so you don't need to continuously check their job boards.

&#x200B;

In the past few months, we've made some major changes! Many of them are [discussed in the changelog](https://zensearch.jobs/changelog):

1. [We now have a much more feature-complete way of matching you to relevant jobs](https://zensearch.jobs/jobs)
2. We've collected a ton of new jobs and companies, so we now have \~2,700 companies in our database and almost 100k open jobs!
3. We've overhauled the UX to make it less noisy and easier for you to find jobs you care about.
4. We also added [a feedback page](https://zensearch.jobs/feedback) to let you submit feedback about the app to us!

&#x200B;

I started building Zen when I was on the job hunt and realized it was harder than it should've been to just get notifications when a company I was interested in posted a job that was relevant to me. And we hope that this goal -- to cut out all the noise and make it easier for you to find great matches -- is valuable for everyone here :)

I'm getting bored of plotly and the usual options. Is there anything new and fancy?,1abyujr,"I was pretty excited to use plotly for the first year or two.  I had been using either matplotlib (ugh) or ggplot, and it was exciting to include some interactivity to my plots which I hadn't been able to before.  

But as some time has passed, I find the syntax cumbersome without any real improvements, and the plots look ugly out-of-the-box.  The colors are too ""primary"", the control box gets in the way, selecting fields on the legend is usually impractical, and it's always zooming in when I don't intend to.  Yes, these things can be changed, but it's just not an inspiring or elegant package.  

ggplot is still elegant to me and I enjoy using it, but it doesn't seem to be adding any features for interactivity or even tooltips which is disappointing.  

I sometimes get the itch to learn D3.js  [D3 by Observable | The JavaScript library for bespoke data visualization (d3js.org)](https://d3js.org/) or echarts  [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) .  The plots look amazing and a whole level above anything I've seen for R or Py, but when I look at the examples, it's staggering how many lines of JS code it takes to make a single plot, and I'm sure it's a headache to link it together with R / Py.  

Am I missing anything?  Does anyone else feel the same way?  Did anyone take the plunge into data viz with JS?  How did it work out?

Companies should give employees a whole week (with no expected deliverables) dedicated to learning each year,1abk6du,"DS and analytics is a vast field and most employees will have gaps in their knowledge/skill that need to be filled.

I feel many know what it is that they want to learn but cannot find time for it with their work load. And therefore, a dedicated learning week which can set expectations with all stakeholders that DS/analytics team is upgrading is must have. Maybe even employees can do knowledge sharing at end of week or start of next week. 

Company can eventually provide learning resources (courses, workshops, trainers etc.) but they shouldn't restrict employees on what they need to learn. It should at max be a discussion between employee and manager, where manager puts in suggestions but employee takes the final call.

Feature Importance for KPIs,1abinn6,"I’m working on tackling daily and weekly swings in some of our key metrics. These metrics are based on similar data coming through our logistics system that basically a waterfall. A change towards the beginning of the process will likely affect a change towards the middle and end unless materials fall out if the process somewhere. We have seen that these metrics do often live together but we don’t currently have a clean way to see causation (or at least correlation) when x metric moves. So when we see a shift in metric A we’re all running around pulling raw data and looking at old dashboards trying to come up with a story.

By building a table with daily granularity and breaking out each KPI by day I’d like to write a model to determine feature importance (as a coefficient) all other metrics have on each other metric. Basically get multiple coefficient scores for each feature (metric) that represents how they impact each other metric. The methods I’m thinking of testing are below, but before I start writing any code I figured I’d ask here to make sure I’m thinking about this the right way. Would also greatly appreciate input from anyone that has built a well-performing feature importance model. I’ll be reading up this weekend as well.

How long to stay in unproductive environment?,19eys1q,"Looking for some career advice as to whether it’s best to stick it out or look for a different opportunity.

I have four years of experience working as a data scientist and several years as a data analyst. I have worked at three different companies (large [10000+] and small [<1000]) and I left my last job because I did not find the industry exciting, but the company overall had a strong data science department. The company also did not pay very well compared to other places.

I have been with my current company for over a year now. I get paid a lot more and enjoy the projects, but our company/team struggles to get models into production for various reasons. Additionally, leadership has a poor understanding of data science. We perform strongly as a business and there are a ton of opportunities to implement machine learning, experimentation, and advanced analytics but our leadership struggles to pave the way. A lot of it is because we never get buy-in from stakeholders. They just want to do the same thing they have been doing for the last 10 years. We also don't have the tech stack or resources to implement data science solutions.

For example, my manager’s idea of machine learning is manually running a notebook every morning and uploading the scores. Our cloud team will not give us access to ML cloud services such as SageMaker or Vertex AI, and our single MLOps engineer is not very experienced so it has been taking them forever to get stuff into production (over a year for a single model [WTF]). The job is not stressful at all, but it is extremely disappointing to not see any of our work have a positive impact like I did at my last job.

Anyway, is it worth sticking out if I don't dislike my manager or projects? Can things turn around at a place like this? I was thinking of bailing, but it is a safe place to be given the current job market.

I interviewed at a startup that I would love to work at and made it to the last round, but the CEO notified me that they decided not to hire right now because they are too busy to onboard, and they will reach out later in Q1. My idea is to wait and see if they extend the offer early this year and if they don't start looking for other jobs.

Online/Batch models,19ejwy6,"In our organization we have the following problem (the reason I am asking here is that I am sure we are not the only place with this need!). We have huge amounts of data that cannot be processed in memory, so our training pipelines usually have steps in spark (joins of big tables and things like that). After this data preparation steps are done, typically we end with a training set that is not so big, and we can use the frameworks we like (pandas, numpy, xgboost, sklearn...).

This approach is fine for batch predictions: at inference time, we just need to redo the spark processing steps and, then, apply the model (which could be a sequence of steps, but all in Python in memory).

However, we don't know what to do for online APIs. We are having the need for those now, and this mix of spark/python does not seem like a good idea. One idea, but limited, would be having two kind of models, online and batch, and online models won't be allowed to use spark at all. But we don't like this approach, because it's limiting and some online models will requiere spark preprocessing for building the training set. Other idea would be to create a function that replicates the same functionality of the spark preprocessing but using pandas under the hood. But this sounds like manual (although I am sure chatGPT could automate it up to some degree) and error-prone. We will need to test that the preprocessings are the same regardless of the engine....

Maybe we could leverage the pandas API on spark, and thanks to duck typing do the same set of transformations to the dataframe object (be it a pandas or a spark dataframe). But we don't have experience with that, so we don't know...

Got my first job. Do I accept?,19drd9y,"Hi Everyone,

As the title states, I have just received a job offer to be a Clinical Data Analyst but, I am having trouble deciding if I should accept the offer.

Some background: I am finishing a Master of Science in Interdisciplinary Graduate Studies with combined Research Communication and Applied Biostatistics and Epidemiology in April. I had a lot of autonomy over my coursework and chose to focus the bulk of it on applied statistics and data analysis. I have also been working as a Clinical Research Coordinator for 4 years at a major academic institution where I have a flexible schedule and free tuition. My background is in Public Health thus I do not have a rigorous math background. I planned on taking classes in math and statistics for 8 more semesters after graduation because why not? It's free. I also plan to start a graduate certificate in business analytics next semester.

The offer, with no counter, is exactly what I make right now. But, I will be losing free school and cannot afford to pay for it myself so I will have to abandon those plans if I accept this offer. On one hand, losing free school feels limiting to my growth. On the other, this is the type of position I am studying for so why should I stay in school if I have achieved that goal? A few other things I am considering: I have a pension that I will not lose, but will not vested it. I will get that money back to roll over into a 401k, I see a therapist for free every three weeks through work, and my health insurance is amazing and incredibly cheap. I know the salary ceiling is much higher for data analysts and I would like to use this experience as a stepping stone towards data science or biostatistics.

I guess my dilemma is, if I want to land in a more advanced role, is school or an entry-level role more valuable? Should I gamble on the chance that I may get a better position with more schooling or should I start learning on the job? What would you guys do in my position?

Other things to note:

* I am burned out and unmotivated at work. I am tired of seeing patients but I still want to work in healthcare.
* My boss is amazing. The best I have ever had. I have full autonomy and I can take classes in person during business hours. If I just did not show up to work one day no one would care because they trust me.
* The new job performs analysis in excel and minitab but I have spent two years working on SAS and R.

Also, if anyone has questions about my application, interview process, or questions in general about data analytics feel free to ask. I know how frustrating this job market is and I am here to help.

&#x200B;

Edit:

To make this situation even trickier, I received an email today asking me to interview for a data analyst position for the same institution I work for in a different department. In that case, I could work as an analyst and continue school for free. The interview would be sometime in February. The doctor who referred me spoke very highly of me and suggested me for the role. I have to give a 30 days notice to leave my current role. Would it be poor practice to accept the original dat analyst offer and continue interviewing during the 30 days? Would it be better to reject that offer in the hopes of getting a new offer? I have so many options it is making my head spin but, I suppose that is a good problem to have.

Bayesian Optimization,19dbh44,"I’ve been reading this [Bayesian Optimization](https://bayesoptbook.com) book currently. It has its uses anytime we want to optimize a black box function where we don’t known the true connection between the inputs and output, but we want to optimize to find a global min/max. This function may be expensive to compute, and finding its global optimum is expensive so we want to “query” points from it to help us get closer to this optimum.

 This book has a lot of good notes on Gaussian processes because this is what is used to actually infer what the objective function is. We place a GP Prior over the space of functions and combine with the likelihood to get a posterior distribution of function, and use the posterior predictive function when we want to pick a new point to query. Good sources on how to model with GPs too and good discussion on kernel functions, model selection for GPs etc.  

Chapters 5-7 are pretty interesting. Ch 6 is on utility functions for optimization. It had me thinking that this chapter could maybe be useful for a data scientist when working with actual business problems. The chapter talks about how to craft utility functions, and I feel could be useful in an applied setting. Especially when we have specific KPIs of interest, framing a data science problem as a utility function (depending on the business case) seems like an interesting framework for solving problems. The chapter talks about how to build optimization policies from first principles. The decision theory chapter is good too.

Managers without a tech/ data background,19cze7c,"A little context before I jump into my question.

I work as a DS at a marketing firm. Specifically I work in the Data Team that does not touch marketing at all, which is a bit ironic imo. And my managers has limited knowledge with data / tech in general. They are mainly business analyst.

Recently, we are having discussions on how the team should think more for the clients when it comes to doing data reports for them.

The problem is that I can pitch all these ideas (forecasting, classification, regressions) etc that can help clients make better campaign decisions, but DS don’t really present to clients directly at my company. In the end, the managers will ignore all those ideas because they don’t understand it or they don’t think it’s a good idea.

On top of that, my managers would sometimes modify the numbers or twist the true interpretation of some metrics on the report just so it “looks good” to the client. Sometimes, I think my company is “marketing and selling the report” more than providing one that is actually data driven.

So how is a DS able to even influence decision when:

1. The team doesn’t touch internal products 
2. Can’t present ideas to client directly 
2. Data is arbitrarily modified to look good

Emphasis on applying for new job....or upskilling? Which would you emphasize? (Lengthy),19c828o,"Howdy folks,

Hope all is well, could use some feedback on the job market and possibly upskilling. So Im currently a Senior Data Analyst at my company, been there for about a year and 8 months. I have tons of analytics/excel/dashboard/marketing/startup experience previously, and took two courses on Udemy in SQL/Tableau and got the role in 2021 after searching for 3 months. 

I've been fairly disappointed with the role/company though. I was told they'd be hiring other analysts and I'd have a team eventually but that never happened. I also get minimal support as Im the ONLY tech/data guy on the US side of the company and constantly feel left on an island. I was also taken off spearheading the major project I was on last year-for this year, and they've kept me out of the loop and not engaged for a long time. They're also a constantly REACTIVE company instead proactive, I've told them this several times and Ive yet to see a change. Im still working with the company and we're starting weekly reports now, which lasts for me until August-as well as that major project is about to start and I will be needed for it for the next couple months. I therefore think my job is somewhat safe for a bit, but always looking at my finances as a just in case to verify my runway/attaining a rainy day fund (I had to deplete what I had last year due to a major car issue). 

I feel stagnant in the role and like I'm not really learning anything or really using my brain well AT ALL for what I'm doing. I'm not really doing data science/engineering much at all and thats kind of more of what I want to do (I have to do much more administrative work than Id prefer, dont mind it but whats the point of paying me to do that when there's people at lower pay than can do that?).

So, here's the thing....as of December I set out to basically leave the company and started looking at jobs/applying. I essentially only wanted to last out the role through the fall/winter last year (oh yeah, the COO/my boss left the company last summer too) when hiring is down and maybe try to find something new come Q1 2024. 

So I looked through jobs in December, and saw some things I should maybe learn up on-like learning more about data warehousing/ETL, etc. I was listing those things out for my own reference and then bought some courses on Udemy, like a Data Warehouse course-which I completed as of the first this year. The next major thing I saw that seemed to come up in apps was Machine Learning. 

I dont have as much experience with things like Python. I can mostly read/understand the language from experience with HTML/CSS and can take Python code previously written for years past, update it for calculations for the current year of data and get it good to go-but writing from scratch I wouldn't be 100% on as of right now. 

In order to skip ahead a bit and improve my marketability, Im going through a Machine Learning course on Udemy in Python. I figured while I'm not an expert in Python, I'm not an idiot either-and I'd rather just have the course explain the Python used here, and go over machine learning at the same time.

Here's my concern though....where would you prioritize here? Im applying to work as of right now, maybe gotten 30-40 apps out in the last couple weeks and one interview so far-which I didnt move forward on. I also workout every day and that takes about an hour and a half-two hours. I've paused on the Machine Learning course for about the last week, as literally applying to jobs is taking MUCH longer in my mornings (having to sign up for workday/employer resume apps, going through the application, and submitting).  I'm not sure how helpful job applying is exactly longer term though compared to learning more.

How would you go about this?

My thoughts are well:

A: If I can get another job, I might be able to learn new things anyways and better mentorship/coaching (and therefore getting the course done isn't as relevant)...so its better to focus on applying....BUT the other part of me says, 

B: Well, if you get a job now, you might be frustrated its not as skilled as you'd prefer since your skills arent there 100% and you're gonna want to find another one or better paying one once you learn more....so its better to get the course done and possibly build out a portfolio (but the course will likely take two months or so to complete, while hiring is up this month/next few). 

I've been applying to jobs Tues-Friday. Maybe 10 or so each day. I have the Machine Learning course listed on my resume when I apply, but list out the percent is done at so far.

How would you go about the attack/emphasize here? I could also possibly try to use some of the data (that I work with) that I have/utilize to run/practice Python or something while working as well.

I'm somewhat torn between, should I focus more on finding a job....or trying to upskill and then make myself more marketable longer term (and possibly make more money as well, etc)?

Yes I can maybe split the days out some and attack at different times, but then you also get less done for each and that definitely takes better focus/discipline.

Would anyone have an idea on which is more important to emphasize here....whether upskilling or just job searching?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/19c828o/emphasis_on_applying_for_new_jobor_upskilling/,WhatsTheAnswerDude,9,Career Discussion,8,New

Let's team up and create an app to detect fermentation issues in style! 🥬🧪,19bnuia,"Hi all

I spend a lot of time on /r/fermentation and I've noticed that many posts there are along the lines of ""I made this thing, is it infected?"" Most of the time, it's perfectly fine. The real dangerous stuff, like mold, is usually easy to spot. This got me thinking about creating an app that allows users to upload photos and get help in identifying obvious issues. 

my tensorflow fu is weak but my data engineer skills are strong. anyone interested in partnering up in putting this together?  what i need from you:

\- Assistance with the TensorFlow (or alternative) model. My preference is to use Python for the web layer.

\- Help in collecting input and validation data. I have come across a few smaller datasets, but I'm not sure if they are extensive enough for training and validating the model.

&#x200B;

Here's what I'll bring to the project:

\- I'll take the TensorFlow model and build a Streamlit app on top of it.

\- The app layer will have a FastAPI backend endpoint.

\- I'll cover all infrastructural or hosting costs.

\- The app will be hosted on Kubernetes (K8s) and available over SSL through Nginx.

\- Any changes committed to GitHub will be deployed through ArgoCD.

&#x200B;

Please note that this is a hobby project and it will never be a paid service. I'm not doing this to enhance my resume; I simply think it's a cool idea that can be (relatively) easily achieved.

&#x200B;

Here are the common contaminants I'd like to identify. The really harmful ones have bright colors that contrast nicely:

&#x200B;

\- Mold: Any mold growth should be considered potentially harmful.

   1. Penicillium: This mold can appear as blue or green patches on the surface of sauerkraut.

   2. Cladosporium: This mold typically appears as black or brown spots.

   3. Aspergillus: This mold can appear in various colors such as green, black, or gray.

   4. Mucor: This mold may show as white or gray fuzzy patches on the surface.

&#x200B;

\- Yeast: Yeast is not typically considered harmful, but it can lead to off flavors.

   1. Kahm yeast is a type of wild yeast . not dangerous but off tasting. It appears as a white or cream-colored film on the surface and can sometimes develop in areas where the brine is exposed to air.

&#x200B;

here is a paper that seems to think its totally feasible with decent accuracy

Is Julius AI worth it?,19awedm,"There's an AI right now that has been trending in its ability to solve data science problems, it is called Julius AI, it allows for a free 10 questions per month to an account.

I've never used GPT4 to test the difference, so my question is for those who have used GPT4 or tried both AIs, is Julius worth it more than GPT4, does GPT4 has an advantage on Julius in data science or data analysis?

How to make a proper train test split,19au18t,"I am trying to predict the conversion rate of company defined groups of customers for various product offers. The company clusters customers into Q groups (these groups overlap) and want to know if we can predict conversion rate (using regression) when offering product Y. I can also potentially model the problem as binary classification  at the customer level and aggregate up later but at the moment I’m modeling @ the customer clustering level (predict conversion rate based on features of each of the Q customer groups)

I have access to historical purchase behaviors of customers and purchase volumes and what not for each product.

Each row of my training set looks like this:
Design matrix:
- Features describing last N days purchase volumes for the cluster of customers (historical purchases before time of marketing offer being made)
- Features describing what proportion of customers bought similar products before the current product offer (similar products defined by nearest K neighbors of product description embedding)

Labels:
- the conversion rate of that customer clustering which can be interpreted as a probability

My question is should I split the training data to be product offers before CUTOFF date and test examples to be after CUTOFF date?

I think that that is potentially the most realistic and anti leakage proof split but I only have 3 years of purchase data and 1 year was covid + 1 year was recession + inflation. Im afraid that doing time splits I will make the test set have substantial seasonal differences and also macroeconomic differences than train set

Conceptually speaking i see no issue with doing a true random train test split of all product offers in 2023. Since each training / testing data row only has features calculated from historical (before the label was ever calculated) purchases. But I am worried that I am missing something and may have leakage. I am not experienced in running and leading projects myself so I want to ensure I am being rigorous and thoughtful

To make things a little more interesting, i need to model both new products and existing products. So i might even make a separate dataset for new product campaigns vs existing campaigns but I am not sure what’s the best approach here

Would love tips and guidance here!!

Side note: yes i could model this as a recommender system problem and build a complicated solution but my company is not a tech company and i am working with a single laptop no cloud.

AB testing e-commerce,19at46x,"I'm a data scientist at a small ecomm company. Because the lift we expect and observe is small (they just are dumb features to start but that's a different story), it takes a while to reach significance. So management often see AB tests as a throwaway thing that are irrelevant to the launch of features. And although the features are dumb, they take engineering and creative a long time to get to MVP (minimal viable product), so they tend to launch regardless of AB test results (sunk cost fallacy).


I want advice from others on how I should/can approach AB testing -
I've been approaching the tests as 'is it good enough to launch?'
Is it bad to switch to 'does it do too much harm?'
So instead of needing significance to say, enough evidence to observe more than 2% lift in conversion beyond random chance, I switch to, this doesn't suck bad enough to observe 10% drop in conversion.
In reframing it as do-no-harm I can set the difference threshold to big enough that business would care to push the emergency-stop button. Or if this is a lose-lose approach? What else do I lose in switching the framing? I am afraid I'd regret the switch, and that management would see AB test as even less valuable (not that they care now...). I'm also afraid they come back needing prove that something was impactful, but we didn't test that way and now we lack data to prove/disprove anything.

"Started new position in healthcare reimbursement analytics, having doubts..",19asgdi,"So, I was in a struggle to find any jobs related to data analytics, I live in a non-metropolitain area, but even applied outside my state, was willing to commute, but my lack of experience left most of my job applications denied for several months.

I have a Bachelors in Psych/ Business and worked in healthcare front-end, was studying a masters in an unrelated humanities degree, then dropped out and finished a data analytics bootcamp online. I created many projects, a website, a portfolio, I networked, went to job fairs, and still ended up only finding entry-levels. 

Currently I'm a couple months into a new role and it's not what thought. The job title was in healthcare, reimbursement analytics, working with insurance and finance to process insurance claims. Mostly customer service, administration and data entry. And while we do use tools like Excel, it's minimal. Practically nothing I learned in my bootcamp (Tableau, PowerBI, PPT, Python, SQL) is utilized here.

The only upside I can see to this role is it looks like am an analyst in finance, there's remote work most of the time (hybrid) and opportunity to go fully remote, as well as possible advancement within the company, and it might be a good resume booster when I decide to find a higher paying role. 

Still, I am having doubts about this position, what is your thoughts in my case, should I stick it through only a year then apply to other companies, or should I try to stay longer and seek advancement opportunities?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/19asgdi/started_new_position_in_healthcare_reimbursement/,the-alchemist-,0,Career Discussion,6,New
Null value work around for this scenario.,19aofgy,"So I’m working on this machine learning project to find improper payments. We will be using a population of every payments that’s been audited. One feature I’m using is how long ago was the vendor last audited. 

An issue that’s going to arise is that for the first instance a vendor is audited there will not be an audit history so the value returned would be null. 

So my thought on it is to put the first possible day that the system was out in place to audit these vouchers as the last audit day. 

Let’s say it was January 1, 2010. And this one particular row is the first instance a vendor has been audited which was July 12, 2023. So I could just subtract those two dates.


With January 1 kinda representing a maximum value without putting infinity. 

However, the issue with that is that’s not all vendors were around on that date. Our assumption is that a longer a vendor goes without being audited then they may be riskier. However, a vendor that  came about last year is pretty new. So if they have never been audited it’s hard to compare them to vendor that’s been around since 2010. 

So instead I was thinking about just using the date of the vendor becoming an entity. 

So if a vendor was made yesterday, then it would just say one day ago was their last audit date. Even though they never been audited. But that was the earliest possible time.

What is the most versatile regression method?,19abxl3,"TLDR: I worked as a data scientist a couple of years back, for most things throwing XGBoost at it was a simple and good enough solution.

To give background to the question, let's start with me. I am a software/ML engineer in Python, R, and Rust and have some data science experience from a couple of years back. Furthermore, I did my undergrad in Econometrics and a graduate degree in Statistics, so I am very familiar with most concepts. I am currently interviewing to switch jobs and the math round and coding round went really well, now I am invited over for a final ""data challenge"" in which I will have roughly 1h and a synthetic dataset with the goal of achieving some sort of prediction.

How costly is it to obtain labeled data? [Q],199z1ud,"Doing my masters thesis in Active Learning.

However, I kinda realized, as much as this active learning stuff is interesting and I’m probably continuing, I just don’t quite get when it would be a realistic scenario in a company for labeled data not being available/being highly costly. Of course, I know when I read it there are specific instances where this occurs:

NLP - tasks like speech recognition may require audio to be labeled, or in information extraction requires annotations and certain things within a corpus to be annotated


However, the literature I’m reading is a survey from like 2009, I’d imagine since then problems like these just don’t exist really. So I’m wondering how often there’s just a pool of unlabeled data waiting to be labeled. Is there even a demand for active learning these days?

"Currently a DS, but looking to continue education…..do I get an MS or just go through a bootcamp?",197g0kv,"My current title is Data Scientist, but I only have a B.S. and 5 yoe as an analyst and then sr analyst (learned almost everything on the job and by self-study). I would like to level up my knowledge as well as pad my resume a bit. To be clear though, I have no plans on leaving my current employer any time soon and plan to stay 15+ years if able so the idea of paying for an MS and spending 3+ years on it (would need to be online, one class per semester) just doesn’t seem worth it to me given my current situation, but the amount of value it’d add longterm is probably priceless given the job market and rapid changes in our industry.

I’m leaning towards a bootcamp (Fullstack Academy specifically) because it’s much cheaper and significantly less of a drain on my energy/time and runs for only ~16 weeks plus I can always get an MS afterwards and the bootcamp might increase my odds of getting in. I’m also still strongly considering just going for an MS in Business Analytics, Economics, or Stats (I work in Fintech) mostly, I’ll admit, due to imposter syndrome, but also because I do see the tremendous value it would add to my knowledge base as well as resume/cv (this is important to me only in case my current employer goes through downsizing at some point). 

About me:
- Late 20s no wife no kids
- Working remotely
- Can dedicate ~4 hrs a day to after-work edu 
- Currently doing mostly clustering, regression, classification, misc viz/reporting work
-  Not strong in deep maths (haven’t needed it in any of my roles yet)

Tips to create a knowledge graph from documents using local models,1976yw3,"I’m developing a chatbot for legal document navigation using a private LLM (Ollama) and encountering challenges with using local models for data pre-processing.

Project Overview:

	•	Goal: Create a chatbot for querying legal documents.
	•	Current State: Basic chat interface with Ollama LLM.
	•	Challenge: Need to answer complex queries spanning multiple documents, such as “Which contracts with client X expire this month?” or “Which statements of work are fixed price with X client”.

Proposed Solution:

	•	Implementing a graph database to extract and connect information, allowing the LLM to generate cypher queries for relevant data retrieval.

Main Issue:

	•	Difficulty in extracting and forming graph connections. The LLM I’m using (Mistral-7b) struggles with processing large text volumes efficiently. Process large amounts of texts takes too long. It works well with chat-gpt but I can’t use that due to the confidentiality of our documents (including private azure instance)

I was given the exciting opportunity to start growing our ML offerings to the company (and team if it goes well), and have some big meetings coming up with IT and higher ups to discuss what tools/resources we will need. This is where I need help. Because I’m a DS team of 1 and this is my first DS role, I’m unsure what platforms/tools we need for legit MLops.

Some Suggestions for Churn/Retention related Analysis,1963nbh," 

I work on DS for an automobile company, but am mostly stuck with SQL related tasks. I have access to a wealth of data, and have been starting some side projects on the data. 

I am thinking of some churn related analysis/predictions.

Our customers get a plan with new car purchase.plan lasts 3-4 years, and they can renew it. I have access to past plans and currently active plans, so I am able to aggregate these in some form for churn/retention analysis. I also have customer data (demographics,appointments at our dealers, etc), and general car information. I have access to which customers we attempted contact(through ads on social media,email, or calls) regarding renewal of plan; dont have whether they actually responded or clicked the ad. We have split the country into different regions too for contacting customers, so breaking it down by region is something I am thinking of.

Here are a few things I have thought of doing:

1. basic statistical analysis, like summary stats; overall churn rate vs region by region vs churn on customer segmentation( customer segmentation might tougher to do due to multiple households)

2)ML based churn prediction

I have a feeling that the features we have might not be too predictive here. Perhaps attempted contact could also be a feature. I am also not sure if seasonality could play here.

3) Somehow incorporate survival analysis here(I've covered SA in coursework, not completely sure how to fit it in, whether I should use multiple groups, and if so, which groups, etc)

I am constrained with the data I have; since its not some official project, I can't necessarily get access to more data, such as who has responded. I can't do any new interventions myself here either, like some sort of AB test.

\-----------

And then on related note, I am thinking the same could be done wrt to data on customers to their first dealership appointment after a new purchase; I think I could use similar ideas such

as basic statistical analysis, some ML prediction, and/or survival analysis.

I am curious about any suggestions/feedback anyone has on these ideas( or any suggestions for something else that can be done on this data given constraints). And should I keep this as more of an exploratory thing as opposed to having some rigorous plan beforehand, where I have all the goals, techniques, and potential subgroups stated before starting?

How to deal with data scientists,194prhf,"I'm an R&D engineer working for an international company in the chemical/engineering business. I am the only one in my team with some data analytics skills. I typically spend about 20% of my time coding and analysing data for my projects (sometimes I get asked to support other colleagues too). Nothing fancy, some statistical analysis, a lot of data viz and sometimes simple modelling mostly for inferential purposes.
Over the years my company built a relatively large and very centralized data science team, they do the heavy lifting and create production quality code.  
In the early days I enjoyed dealing with them, they were happy that I could read the code and understand the lingo so we could cooperate very smoothly on the same project. Typically we went through their code together on a weekly basis. By the end of the project  I was aware of most of the technical decision made along the way and I could explain it pretty comfortably to the stakeholders. So much so that I started thing about a career switch. Now that team is gone and the newcomers are more senior and operate very differently. They typically provide their report on powerpoint and quite high level too, I had a few instances when I reached out and got dismissed. One particular time after they analysed some data for an RD&E project I asked the code specifying that I was really eager to learn and I got denied. Their justification was that they were afraid their code would be used the wrong way.  
They don't seem to be interested in cooperating the same way, they rather get the data, ask all the questions, and share their final findings. They do not interact much along the way.

This situation has been going on for over a year already, I thought I could find a sweet spot bridging between RD&E and data science, but I'm now having second thoughts and thinking I'm better off in my bubble. I'm very hesitant involving them in any project unless strictly necessary.   
I'm interested to hear some opinion from data scientists as I'm trying to put myself in their shoes. Am I being too intrusive? Have you ever had similar experiences from the opposite side? Also do you have any career advice?

bayesianbandits - Production-tested multi-armed bandits for Python,194lncp,"My team recently open-sourced [bayesianbandits, the multi-armed bandit microframework](https://github.com/bayesianbandits/bayesianbandits) we use in production. We built it on top of scikit-learn for maximum compatibility with the rest of the DS ecosystem. It features:


**Simple API** - scikit-learn-style pull and update methods make iteration quick for both contextual and non-contextual bandits:

    import numpy as np
    from bayesianbandits import (
        Arm,
        NormalInverseGammaRegressor,
    )
    from bayesianbandits.api import (
        ContextualAgent,
        UpperConfidenceBound,
    )

    arms = [
        Arm(1, learner=NormalInverseGammaRegressor()),
        Arm(2, learner=NormalInverseGammaRegressor()),
        Arm(3, learner=NormalInverseGammaRegressor()),
        Arm(4, learner=NormalInverseGammaRegressor()),
    ]
    policy = UpperConfidenceBound(alpha=0.84)    
    agent = ContextualAgent(arms, policy)

    context = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0]])

    # Can be constructed with sklearn, formulaic, patsy, etc...
    # context = formulaic.Formula(""1 + article_number"").get_model_matrix(data)
    # context = sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder().fit_transform(data)

    decision = agent.pull(context)
    
    # update with observed reward
    agent.update(context, np.array([15.0]))


**Sparse Bayesian linear regression** - Plenty of available libraries provide the classic beta-binomial multi-armed bandit, but we found linear bandits to be a much more powerful modeling tool to handle problems where arms have variable cost/reward (think dynamic pricing), when you want to pool information between contexts (hierarchical problems), and similar such situations. Plus, it made the economists on our team happy to perform reinforcement learning with linear regression. We provide [Normal-Inverse Gamma regression](https://bayesianbandits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/_autosummary/bayesianbandits.NormalInverseGammaRegressor.html#bayesianbandits.NormalInverseGammaRegressor) (aka Bayesian Ridge regression) out of the box in bayesianbandits, enabling users to set up a Bayesian version of [Disjoint LinearUCB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0146.pdf) with minimal boilerplate. In fact, that's what's done in the code block above!

**Joblib compatibility** - Store agents as blobs in a database, in S3, wherever you might store a scikit-learn model

    import joblib

    joblib.dump(agent, ""agent.pkl"")

    loaded: Agent[GammaRegressor, str] = joblib.load(""agent.pkl"")
 
**Battle-tested** - We use these models to handle a number of decisions in production, including dynamic geo-pricing, intelligent promotional campaigns, and optimizing marketing copy. Some of these models have tens or hundreds of thousands of features and this library handles them with ease (especially in conjunction with SuiteSparse). The library itself is highly-tested and has yet to let us down in prod.  

**How does it work?**

Each arm is represented by a scikit-learn-compatible estimator representing a Bayesian model with a conjugate prior. Pulling consists of the following workflow:

1. Sample from the posterior of each arm's model parameters 
2. Use some policy function to summarize these samples into an estimate of expected reward of that arm
3. Pick the arm with the largest reward

Updating follows a similar conjugate Bayesian workflow:

1. Treat the arm's current knowledge as a prior
2. Combine prior with observed reward to compute the new posterior

Conjugate Bayesian inference allows us to perform sequential learning, preventing us from ever having to re-train on historical data. These models can live ""in the wild"" - training on bits and pieces of reward data as it comes in - providing high availability without requiring the maintenance overhead of slow background training jobs. 

These components are highly pluggable - implementing your own policy function or estimator is simple enough if you check out our [API documentation and usage notebooks](https://bayesianbandits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

"Decide to build an API dashboard, but have no API",194kfrh,"I've decided to create API dashboards for public use and also to strengthen my portfolio.

How people with a PhD and or years of experience see the market: A discussion,194g5m4,"First of all, although I wanted to hear from another experienced people in the market any opinion is welcome.

Second, because I think that, in this job, years of experience will give the same soft and hard skills that usually are learnt from a PhD and people who do a PhD in the area already have 4 years of academic experience in the area.

I came from a math PhD and was talked to, about Data Science, by other friends with a master and/or a PhD. The question is that the knowledge needed to work was the set of skills that they had. But I see that I lot of people entering the field have a huge gap between what I think is needed to be a Data Scientist and what they have (this is not a rant, my point will be clear I think haha). 

For example, what I do now is usually called Ops Research and/or modeling and I'm shifting to this path. I do different projects and some of them involved ""solving"" (making a better solution) 3D bin packing problem, optimization, risk analysis and other things ""more"" data sciency. I believe most of my friends working on the data market could also work on these projects.

So my question is, you more experienced people workin on within this market do you think that in the future DS jobs will be geared towards with oops research skills? I see some companies hiring such people to work on their data teams, but I don't if this is a relevant trend.

Second question, do you also see a relevant gap of hard skills between people working on this market? Or this is a temporary thing because of the cash grabbers?

My point here is not to brag, I wanted to hear for experienced people in other countries also. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/194g5m4/how_people_with_a_phd_and_or_years_of_experience/,magikarpa1,12,Discussion,61,New
Is it normal to spend a day on something that doesn't work?,194f2jz,"I recently started a co-op at a large retail organization and was working on my first real assignment, which involved trying to find a way to improve accuracy of a model (I dont want to get much more detailed, but i know that's not very clear lol). I spent the day trying out a few methods, testing, gathering results, etc, but all of the things i tried, including things suggested by my manager, either performed the same or _marginally_ better, and didnt really accomplish the large scale goal we were trying to achieve. I was truly working and actually ""doing stuff,"" so i wasnt slacking off, but it doesn't feel like I have much to show for it. Is this normal or did I do something wrong/do ""bad"" DS? I know stuff like this is iterative, but I'm wondering if things like this are supposed to be quick and I moved too slowly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/194f2jz/is_it_normal_to_spend_a_day_on_something_that/,Dyljam2345,132,Discussion,106,New
